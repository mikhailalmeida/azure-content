## Introduction

Device twins are JSON documents that store device state information (metadata, configurations, and conditions). IoT Hub persists a device twin for each device that you connect to IoT Hub.

Use device twins to:

* Store device metadata from your back end.
* Report current state information such as available capabilities and conditions (for example, the connectivity method used) from your device app.
* Synchronize the state of long-running workflows (such as firmware and configuration updates) between device app and back end.
* Query your device metadata, configuration, or state.

> [AZURE.NOTE] Device twins are designed for synchronization and for querying device configurations and conditions. Use [device-to-cloud messages][lnk-d2c] for sequences of timestamped events (such as telemetry streams of time-based sensor data) and [direct methods][lnk-methods] for interactive control of devices, such as turning on a fan from a user-controlled app.

Device twins are stored in an IoT hub and contain:

* *tags*, device metadata accessible only by the back end;
* *desired properties*, JSON objects modifiable by the back end and observable by the device app; and
* *reported properties*, JSON objects modifiable by the device app and readable by the back end. Tags and properties cannot contain arrays, but objects can be nested.

Additionally, the app back end can query device twins based on all the above data.
Refer to [Understand device twins][lnk-twins] for more information about device twins and to the [IoT Hub query language][lnk-query] reference for querying.

> [AZURE.NOTE] At this time, device twins are accessible only from devices that connect to IoT Hub using the MQTT protocol. Please refer to the [MQTT support][lnk-devguide-mqtt] article for instructions on how to convert existing device app to use MQTT.

This tutorial shows you how to:

- Create a back-end app that adds *tags* to a device twin, and a simulated device that reports its connectivity channel as a *reported property* on the device twin.
- Query devices from your back end app using filters on the tags and properties previously created.
