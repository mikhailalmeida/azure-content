### How much do reverse DNS records cost?
They’re free!  There is no additional cost for reverse DNS records or queries.

### Will the reverse DNS records for my Azure-assigned Public IP Address resolve from the internet?
Yes. Once you set the reverse DNS property for your Public IP Address, Azure manages all the DNS delegations and DNS zones required to ensure that reverse DNS record resolves for all internet users.

### Will a default reverse DNS record be created for my Public IP Addresses?

### What is the format for the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN)?
FQDNs are specified in forward order, and must be terminated by a dot (e.g., “app1.contoso.com.”).

### What happens if the validation checks for the reverse DNS I’ve specified fail?
Where the validation for reverse DNS checks fail, the service management operation will fail. Please correct the reverse DNS value as required, and retry.
