When you create a virtual network gateway, you need to specify the gateway SKU that you want to use. When you select a higher gateway SKU, more CPUs and network bandwidth are allocated to the gateway, and as a result, the gateway can support higher network throughput to the virtual network. 

ExpressRoute virtual network gateways can use the following SKUs: 

- Standard
- HighPerformance
- UltraPerformance

>[AZURE.IMPORTANT] ExpressRoute UltraPerformance gateway is currently available in the US West Central and US Central regions and can be linked to ExpressRoute circuits located in Chicago and Dallas. More Azure regions and ExpressRoute locations will become available in the coming weeks.
