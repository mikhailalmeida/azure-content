# Azure technical content channel guidance

GitHub is a relatively easy way (once you get over the Git hump) to author and publish technical content. But we need to ensure that content stays within the boundaries of technical documentation - there are other channels for other types of information.

##Technical content that belongs in the azure-content-pr repository

**Technical articles about using the product** belong in the azure-content and azure-content-pr repositories for publication to http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles. They should contain conceptual or procedural information required to understand and use the product. The technical content channel is for technical content showing people **how** to do something. You can talk about the "what" and "why" to help customers understand intent, but the articles should focus on the actual content telling people how to do the task or complete the scenario.

##Technical content that does not belong in the azure-content-pr repository

**Reference content**: managed reference, REST APIs, PowerShell cmdlet help, schema reference, and error reference belongs in the MSDN scoped Azure library (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/). Node, Ruby, and other language reference content belongs on http://azure.github.io/.

The following types of content are delivered in other Azure or Microsoft content channels; in some cases, certain types of content are not part of our content strategy.

- **Blog posts**: Blog posts are typically written in the first person voice and are generally related to announcements and promotions. This sort of content typically belongs on the Azure blog. Deeply technical or procedural content does not go on the blog.

- **Case studies/customer stories**: Case studies and customer stories are a very specific deliverable that goes through marketing, they have their own process and guidelines and are created from specific customer and partner engagements. They are published to https://customers.microsoft.com/. Don't call something a case study or customer story unless it's part of the formal case study process, and don't publish it to the tech content repository.

- **Code and project samples**: Code and project samples go in the samples repositories and are featured in the sample gallery.

- **Community spotlight/community resources**: Articles featuring community projects. The repo is for technical content about how to use the product from the Microsoft persective, not about how people are using the product. That's marketing or possibly blog content. Or, let the community tell it's own story in the places that community likes best!

- **Compliance**: Industry standards and compliance information for Azure services must be posted to https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/TrustCenter/Compliance?service=Azure#Icons. This includes certification for standards such as ISO, country-specific and government certifications, banking, health, or other certifications.

- **Downloadable files**: Technical documents should be delivered as articles, not downloads. Do not create downloadable PDFs of content from the technical content repository. Other downloabable things should go to the Download Center.

- **Feedback - soliciting feedback via email addresses**: The approved feedback paths for Azure content include the feedback link that appears in the site footer, the satisfaction rating and verbatim control, the Disqus comments, direct article contributions through GitHub pull requests, and the UserVoice site. Please don't add to this plethora of channels by asking people to send feedback via email.

- **Future product plans**: Do not publish statements about future product plans in technical documentation. Technical documentation should describe only what is possible in the released product.

- **Legal terms**: There are all-up Azure legal terms: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/

- **Marketing content**: Content that provides a high-level feature/benefit description or that just lists at a high level the capabilities of a service is probably marketing content. It belongs in marketing areas of the site. To publish marketing content, file a work request for azure.microsoft.com.

- **Pricing information**: You can talk about the impact technical choices have on cost in a general way, but do not quote specific pricing details in technical articles. Instead, provide a link to the pricing page for the service you're talking about.

- **Pointer articles to downloads**: Instead of pointing small pages that contain nothing but a link to a download, just link to the download from the relevant technical content.

- **Privacy information**: There is an all-up privacy policy for Microsoft Online Services that covers all of Azure. Privacy information specific to a service should be presented as technical content, not "privacy statements". See https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/.

- **Redirect articles**:  When you delete the content of an article, do not leave the article published with a link to the replacement content. Use a real redirect.

- **Release notes**: Unless it's an SDK article or a StorSimple article for a hardware update, this sort of information should just be embedded in the relevant technical content or included in the service updates channel.

- **What's new in a release or service**:  Lists or descriptions of what is new in a release or service go to the Service Updates channel.
