## Scenario introduction: “Hello, Toll!”


A toll station is a common phenomenon. You encounter them on many expressways, bridges, and tunnels across the world. Each toll station has multiple toll booths. At manual booths, you stop to pay the toll to an attendant. At automated booths, a sensor on top of each booth scans an RFID card that's affixed to the windshield of your vehicle as you pass the toll booth. It is easy to visualize the passage of vehicles through these toll stations as an event stream over which interesting operations can be performed.

## Incoming data

This tutorial works with two streams of data. Sensors installed in the entrance and exit of the toll stations produce the first stream. The second stream is a static lookup dataset that has vehicle registration data.

### Entry data stream

The entry data stream contains information about cars as they enter toll stations.

## Set up the environment for Azure Stream Analytics

To complete this tutorial, you need a Microsoft Azure subscription. Microsoft offers free trial for Microsoft Azure services.

If you do not have an Azure account, you can [request a free trial version](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

> [AZURE.NOTE] To sign up for a free trial, you need a mobile device that can receive text messages and a valid credit card.

Be sure to follow the steps in the “Clean up your Azure account” section at the end of this article so that you can make the best use of your $200 free Azure credit.

## Provision Azure resources required for the tutorial

This tutorial requires two event hubs to receive *entry* and *exit* data streams. Azure SQL Database outputs the results of the Stream Analytics jobs. Azure Storage stores reference data about vehicle registrations.

You can use the Setup.ps1 script in the TollApp folder on GitHub to create all required resources. In the interest of time, we recommend that you run it. If you would like to learn more about how to configure these resources in the Azure portal, refer to the “Configuring tutorial resources in Azure portal” appendix.

Download and save the supporting [TollApp](http://download.microsoft.com/download/D/4/A/D4A3C379-65E8-494F-A8C5-79303FD43B0A/TollApp.zip) folder and files.

Open a **Microsoft Azure PowerShell** window _as an administrator_. If you do not yet have Azure PowerShell, follow the instructions in [Install and configure Azure PowerShell](../powershell-install-configure.md) to install it.

Because Windows automatically blocks .ps1, .dll, and .exe files, you need to set the execution policy before you run the script. Make sure the Azure PowerShell window is running _as an administrator_. Run **Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted**. When prompted, type **Y**.

![Screenshot of "Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted" running in Azure PowerShell window](media/stream-analytics-build-an-iot-solution-using-stream-analytics/image2.png)

Run **Get-ExecutionPolicy** to make sure that the command worked.

![Screenshot of "Get-ExecutionPolicy" running in Azure PowerShell window](media/stream-analytics-build-an-iot-solution-using-stream-analytics/image3.png)

Go to the directory that has the scripts and generator application.

![Screenshot of "cd .\TollApp\TollApp" running in the Azure PowerShell window](media/stream-analytics-build-an-iot-solution-using-stream-analytics/image4.png)

Type **.\\Setup.ps1** to set up your Azure account, create and configure all required resources, and start to generate events. The script randomly picks up a region to create your resources. To explicitly specify a region, you can pass the **-location** parameter as in the following example:

**.\\Setup.ps1 -location “Central US”**

![Screenshot of the Azure sign-in page](media/stream-analytics-build-an-iot-solution-using-stream-analytics/image5.png)

The script opens the **Sign In** page for Microsoft Azure. Enter your account credentials.

> [AZURE.NOTE] If your account has access to multiple subscriptions, you will be asked to enter the subscription name that you want to use for the tutorial.

The script can take several minutes to run. After it finishes, the output should look like the following screenshot.

![Screenshot of output of the script in the Azure PowerShell window](media/stream-analytics-build-an-iot-solution-using-stream-analytics/image6.PNG)

You will also see another window that's similar to the following screenshot. This application is sending events to Azure Event Hubs, which is required to run the tutorial. So, do not stop the application or close this window until you finish the tutorial.

![Screenshot of "Sending event hub data"](media/stream-analytics-build-an-iot-solution-using-stream-analytics/image7.png)

You should be able to see all created resources in Azure portal now. Go to <https://manage.windowsazure.com>, and sign in with your account credentials.

### Azure Event Hubs

Click **SERVICE BUS** on the left side of the Azure portal to see event hubs that the script created in the previous section.

## Azure Stream analytics query

The **QUERY** tab contains a SQL query that transforms the incoming data.

![A query added to the Query tab](media/stream-analytics-build-an-iot-solution-using-stream-analytics/image39.jpg)

This tutorial attempts to answer several business questions that are related to toll data and constructs Stream Analytics queries that can be used in Azure Stream Analytics to provide a relevant answer.

Before you start your first Stream Analytics job, let’s explore a few scenarios and the query syntax.

## Introduction to Azure Stream Analytics query language
-----------------------------------------------------

Let’s say that you need to count the number of vehicles that enter a toll booth. Because this is a continuous stream of events, you have to define a “period of time.” Let's modify the question to be “How many vehicles enter a toll booth every three minutes?”. This is commonly referred to as the tumbling count.

Let’s look at the Azure Stream Analytics query that answers this question:

	SELECT TollId, System.Timestamp AS WindowEnd, COUNT(*) AS Count
	FROM EntryStream TIMESTAMP BY EntryTime
	GROUP BY TUMBLINGWINDOW(minute, 3), TollId

As you can see, Azure Stream Analytics uses a query language that's like SQL and adds a few extensions to specify time-related aspects of the query.

For more details, read about [Time Management](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt582045.aspx) and [Windowing](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn835019.aspx)
constructs used in the query from MSDN.

## Testing Azure Stream Analytics queries

Now that you have written your first Azure Stream Analytics query, it is time to test it by using sample data files located in your TollApp folder in the following path:

**..\\TollApp\\TollApp\\Data**

This folder contains the following files:

- Entry.json
- Exit.json
- Registration.json

## Question 1: Number of vehicles entering a toll booth

1. Open the Azure portal and go to your created Azure Stream Analytics job. Click the **QUERY** tab and paste query from the previous section.

	![Query pasted in the Query tab](media/stream-analytics-build-an-iot-solution-using-stream-analytics/image40.png)

2. To validate this query against sample data, click the **Test** button. In the dialog box that opens, go to Entry.json, a file that has sample data from the **EntryTime** event stream.

	![Screenshot of the Entry.json file](media/stream-analytics-build-an-iot-solution-using-stream-analytics/image41.png)

3. Validate that the output of the query is as expected:

	![Results of the test](media/stream-analytics-build-an-iot-solution-using-stream-analytics/image42.jpg)

## Question 2: Report total time for each car to pass through the toll booth

The average time that's required for a car to pass through the toll helps to assess the efficiency of the process and the customer experience.

To find the total time, you need to join the EntryTime stream with the ExitTime stream. You will join the streams on TollId and LicencePlate columns. The **JOIN** operator requires you to specify temporal leeway that describes the acceptable time difference between the joined events. You will use **DATEDIFF** function to specify that events should be no more than 15 minutes from each other. You will also apply the **DATEDIFF** function to exit and entry times to compute the actual time that a car spends in the toll station. Note the difference of the use of **DATEDIFF** when it's used in a **SELECT** statement rather than a **JOIN** condition.

	SELECT EntryStream.TollId, EntryStream.EntryTime, ExitStream.ExitTime, EntryStream.LicensePlate, DATEDIFF (minute , EntryStream.EntryTime, ExitStream.ExitTime) AS DurationInMinutes
	FROM EntryStream TIMESTAMP BY EntryTime
	JOIN ExitStream TIMESTAMP BY ExitTime
	ON (EntryStream.TollId= ExitStream.TollId AND EntryStream.LicensePlate = ExitStream.LicensePlate)
	AND DATEDIFF (minute, EntryStream, ExitStream ) BETWEEN 0 AND 15

1. To test this query, update the query on the **QUERY** tab of your job:

	![Updated query in the Query tab](media/stream-analytics-build-an-iot-solution-using-stream-analytics/image43.jpg)

2. Click **Test** and specify sample input files for EntryTime and ExitTime.

	![Screenshot of selected input files](media/stream-analytics-build-an-iot-solution-using-stream-analytics/image44.png)

3. Select the check box to test the query and view the output:

	![Output of the test](media/stream-analytics-build-an-iot-solution-using-stream-analytics/image45.png)

## Question 3: Report all commercial vehicles with expired registration

Azure Stream Analytics can use static snapshots of data to join with temporal data streams. To demonstrate this capability, use the following sample question.

If a commercial vehicle is registered with the toll company, it can pass through the toll booth without being stopped for inspection. You will use Commercial Vehicle Registration lookup table to identify all commercial vehicles that have expired registrations.

	SELECT EntryStream.EntryTime, EntryStream.LicensePlate, EntryStream.TollId, Registration.RegistrationId
	FROM EntryStream TIMESTAMP BY EntryTime
	JOIN Registration
	ON EntryStream.LicensePlate = Registration.LicensePlate
	WHERE Registration.Expired = '1'

To test a query by using reference data, you need to define an input source for the reference data, which you have done already.

1. To test this query, paste the query into the **QUERY** tab, click **Test**, and specify the two input sources:

	![Screenshot of selected input files](media/stream-analytics-build-an-iot-solution-using-stream-analytics/image46.png)

2. View the output of the query:

	![Screenshot of query output](media/stream-analytics-build-an-iot-solution-using-stream-analytics/image47.png)

## Start the Stream Analytics job


Now it's time to finish the configuration and start the job. Save the query from Question 3, which will produce output that matches the schema of the **TollDataRefJoin** output table.

Go to the job **DASHBOARD**, and click **START**.

![Screenshot of the Start button in the job dashboard](media/stream-analytics-build-an-iot-solution-using-stream-analytics/image48.jpg)

In the dialog box that opens, change the **START OUTPUT** time to **CUSTOM TIME**. Change the hour to one hour before the current time. This change ensures that all events from the event hub are processed since you started to generate the events at the beginning of the tutorial. Now click the check mark to start the job.

![Selection of custom time](media/stream-analytics-build-an-iot-solution-using-stream-analytics/image49.png)

Starting the job can take a few minutes. You can see the status on the top-level page for Stream Analytics.

## Scale out Azure Stream Analytics jobs

Azure Stream Analytics is designed to elastically scale so that it can handle a lot of data. The Azure Stream Analytics query can use a **PARTITION BY** clause to tell the system that this step will scale out. **PartitionId** is a special column that the system adds to match the partition ID of the input (event hub).

	SELECT TollId, System.Timestamp AS WindowEnd, COUNT(*)AS Count
	FROM EntryStream TIMESTAMP BY EntryTime PARTITION BY PartitionId
	GROUP BY TUMBLINGWINDOW(minute,3), TollId, PartitionId

1. Stop the current job, update the query in the **QUERY** tab, and open the **SCALE** tab.

	**STREAMING UNITS** define the amount of compute power that the job can receive.

2. Move the slider to 6.

3. Go to the **OUTPUTS** tab and change the name of the SQL table to **TollDataTumblingCountPartitioned**.

If you start the job now, Azure Stream Analytics can distribute work across more compute resources and achieve better throughput. Please note that the TollApp application is also sending events partitioned by TollId.

## Monitor

The **MONITOR** tab contains statistics about the running job.

## Conclusion

This tutorial introduced you to the Azure Stream Analytics service. It demonstrated how to configure inputs and outputs for the Stream Analytics job. Using the Toll Data scenario, the tutorial explained common types of problems that arise in the space of data in motion and how they can be solved with simple SQL-like queries in Azure Stream Analytics. The tutorial described SQL extension constructs for working with temporal data. It showed how to join data streams, how to enrich the data stream with static reference data, and how to scale out a query to achieve higher throughput.

Although this tutorial provides a good introduction, it is not complete by any means. You can find more query patterns using the SAQL language at [Query examples for common Stream Analytics usage patterns](stream-analytics-stream-analytics-query-patterns.md).
Refer to the [online documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/stream-analytics/) to learn more about Azure Stream Analytics.

## Clean up your Azure account

1. Stop the Stream Analytics job in the Azure portal.

	The Setup.ps1 script creates two event hubs and a SQL database. The following instructions help you clean up resources at the end of the tutorial.

2. In a PowerShell window, type **.\\Cleanup.ps1** to start the script that deletes resources used in the tutorial.
