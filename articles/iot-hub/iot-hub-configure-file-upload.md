# Configure file uploads using the Azure portal

## File upload

To use the [file upload functionality in IoT Hub][lnk-upload], you must first associate an Azure Storage account with your hub. Select the **File upload** settings to display a list of file upload properties for the IoT hub that is being modified.

**Storage container**: Use the Azure portal to select a blob container in an Azure Storage account in your current Azure subscription to associate with your IoT Hub. If necessary, you can create an Azure Storage account on the **Storage accounts** blade and blob container on the **Containers** blade. IoT Hub automatically generates SAS URIs with write permissions to this blob container for devices to use when they upload files.

**Receive notifications for uploaded files**: Enable or disable file upload notifications via the toggle.

**SAS TTL**: This setting is the time-to-live of the SAS URIs returned to the device by IoT Hub. Set to one hour by default but can be customized to other values using the slider.

**File notification settings default TTL**: The time-to-live of a file upload notification before it is expired. Set to one day by default but can be customized to other values using the slider.

**File notification maximum delivery count**: The number of times the IoT Hub attempts to deliver a file upload notification. Set to 10 by default but can be customized to other values using the slider.
