# Azure IoT Gateway SDK (beta) â€“ send device-to-cloud messages with a simulated device using Linux

[AZURE.INCLUDE [iot-hub-gateway-sdk-simulated-selector](../../includes/iot-hub-gateway-sdk-simulated-selector.md)]

## Build and run the sample

Before you get started, you must:

- [Set up your development environment][lnk-setupdevbox] for working with the SDK on Linux.
- [Create an IoT hub][lnk-create-hub] in your Azure subscription, you will need the name of your hub to complete this walkthrough. If you don't have an account, you can create a [free account][lnk-free-trial] in just a couple of minutes.
- Add two devices to your IoT hub and make a note of their ids and device keys. You can use the [Device Explorer or iothub-explorer][lnk-explorer-tools] tool to add your devices to the IoT hub you created in the previous step and retrieve their keys.

To build the sample:

1. Open a shell.
2. Navigate to the root folder in your local copy of the **azure-iot-gateway-sdk** repository.
3. Run the **tools/build.sh** script. This script uses the **cmake** utility to create a folder called **build** in the root folder of your local copy of the **azure-iot-gateway-sdk** repository and generate a makefile. The script then builds the solution and runs the tests.

> [AZURE.NOTE]  Every time you run the **build.sh** script, it deletes and then recreates the **build** folder in the root folder of your local copy of the **azure-iot-gateway-sdk** repository.

To run the sample:

In a text editor, open the file **samples/simulated_device_cloud_upload/src/simulated_device_cloud_upload_lin.json** in your local copy of the **azure-iot-gateway-sdk** repository. This file configures the modules in the sample gateway:

- The **IoTHub** module connects to your IoT hub. You must configure it to send data to your IoT hub. Specifically, set the **IoTHubName** value to the name of your IoT hub and set the **IoTHubSuffix** value to **azure-devices.net**. Set the **Transport** value to one of: "HTTP", "AMQP", or "MQTT". Note that currently, only "HTTP" will share one TCP connection for all device messages. If you set the value to "AMQP", or "MQTT", the gateway will maintain a separate TCP connection to IoT Hub for each device.
- The **mapping** module maps the MAC addresses of your simulated devices to your IoT Hub device ids. Make sure that **deviceId** values match the ids of the two devices you added to your IoT hub, and that the **deviceKey** values contain the keys of your two devices.
- The **BLE1** and **BLE2** modules are the simulated devices. Note how their MAC addresses match those in the **mapping** module.
- The **Logger** module logs your gateway activity to a file.
- The **module path** values shown below assume that you will run the sample from the root of your local copy of the **azure-iot-gateway-sdk** repository.
- The **links** array at the bottom of the JSON file connects the **BLE1** and **BLE2** modules to the **mapping** module, and the **mapping** module to the **IoTHub** module. It also ensures that all messages are logged by the **Logger** module.

        },

        { "source" : "BLE2", "sink" : "mapping" },
        { "source" : "mapping", "sink" : "IoTHub" }
    ]
}

```

Save any changes you made to the configuration file.

To run the sample:

1. In your shell, navigate to the root folder in your local copy of the **azure-iot-gateway-sdk** repository.
2. Run the following command:

    ```
    ./build/samples/simulated_device_cloud_upload/simulated_device_cloud_upload_sample ./samples/simulated_device_cloud_upload/src/simulated_device_cloud_upload_lin.json
    ```

3. You can use the [Device Explorer or iothub-explorer][lnk-explorer-tools] tool to monitor the messages that IoT hub receives from the gateway.
