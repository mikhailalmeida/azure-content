# Run a sample application to send device-to-cloud messages

## What you will do

This article will show you how to deploy and run a sample application on Raspberry Pi 3 that sends messages to your IoT hub. If you have any problems, look for solutions on the [troubleshooting page](iot-hub-raspberry-pi-kit-node-troubleshooting.md).

## What you will learn

You will learn how to use the gulp tool to deploy and run the sample Node.js application on Pi.

## What you need

Before you start this task, you must have successfully completed [Create an Azure function app and a storage account to process and store IoT hub messages](iot-hub-raspberry-pi-kit-node-lesson3-deploy-resource-manager-template.md).

## Get your IoT hub and device connection strings

The device connection string is used to connect Pi to your IoT hub. The IoT hub connection string is used to connect your IoT hub to the device identity that represents Pi in the IoT hub.

- Get the IoT hub connection string by running the following Azure CLI command:

```bash
az iot hub show-connection-string --name {my hub name} --resource-group iot-sample
```

`{my hub name}` is the name that you specified when you created your IoT hub and registered Pi. Use `iot-sample` as the value of `{resource group name}` if you didn't change the value.

- Get the device connection string by running the following command:

```bash
az iot device show-connection-string --hub {my hub name} --device-id myraspberrypi --resource-group iot-sample
```

`{my hub name}` takes the same value as the one used with the preceding command. Use `iot-sample` as the value of `{resource group name}` and use `myraspberrypi` as the value of `{device id}` if you didn't change the value.

## Configure the device connection

1. Initialize the configuration file by running the following commands:

    ```bash
    npm install
    gulp init
    ```

2. Open the device configuration file `config-raspberrypi.json` in Visual Studio Code by running the following command:

    ```bash
    # For Windows command prompt
    code %USERPROFILE%\.iot-hub-getting-started\config-raspberrypi.json

    # For macOS or Ubuntu
    code ~/.iot-hub-getting-started/config-raspberrypi.json
    ```

    ![config.json](media/iot-hub-raspberry-pi-lessons/lesson3/config.png)

3. Make the following replacements in the `config-raspberrypi.json` file:

  - Replace **[device hostname or IP address]** with the device IP address or host name you got from `device-discovery-cli` or with the value inherited when you configured your device.
  - Replace **[IoT device connection string]** with the `device connection string` you obtained.
  - Replace **[IoT hub connection string]** with the `iot hub connection string` you obtained.

Update the `config-raspberrypi.json` file so that you can deploy the sample application from your computer.

## Deploy and run the sample application

Deploy and run the sample application on Pi by running the following command:

```bash
gulp
```

> [AZURE.NOTE] The default gulp task runs `install-tools`, `deploy`, and `run` tasks sequentially. When you [deployed the blink app](iot-hub-raspberry-pi-kit-node-lesson1-deploy-blink-app.md), you ran these tasks separately.

## Verify that the sample application works

You should see the LED that is connected to Pi blinking every two seconds. Every time the LED blinks, the sample application sends a message to your IoT hub and verifies that the message has been successfully sent to your IoT hub. In addition, each message received by the IoT hub is printed in the console window. The sample application terminates automatically after sending 20 messages.

## Summary

You've deployed and run the new blink sample application on Pi to send device-to-cloud messages to your IoT hub. You can now monitor your messages as they are written to the storage account.
