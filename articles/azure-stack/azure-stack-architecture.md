## Virtual machine roles
The Azure Stack POC offers services using the following VMs on the POC host:

 - **MAS-ACS01** Virtual machine hosting Azure Stack storage services.

 - **MAS-ADFS01** Virtual machine hosting Active Directory Federation Services.  This virtual machine is not used in Technical Preview 2.  

 - **MAS-ASQL01**  Virtual machine providing an internal data store for Azure Stack infrastructure roles.  

 - **MAS-BGPNAT01** Virtual Machine acting as an edge router and provides NAT and VPN capabilities for Azure Stack.

 - **MAS-CA01** Virtual machine providing certificate authority services for Azure Stack role services.

 - **MAS-CON01** Virtual machine available to developers for installing PowerShell, Visual Studio, and other tools.

 - **MAS-DC01** Virtual machine hosting Active Directory, DNS, and DHCP services for Microsoft Azure Stack.

 - **MAS-GWY01** Virtual machine providing edge gateway services such as VPN site-to-site connections for tenant networks.

 - **MAS-NC01**  Virtual machine hosting Network Controller, which manages Azure Stack network services.  

 - **MAS-SLB01**  Virtual machine provides load balancing services in Azure Stack for both tenants and Azure Stack infrastructure services.  

 - **MAS-SUS01**  Virtual machine hosting Windows Server Update Services, and responsible for providing updates to other Azure Stack virtual machines.

 - **MAS-WAS01**  Virtual machine hosting portal and Azure Resource Manager services.

 - **MAS-XRP01** Virtual machine that hosts the core resource providers of Microsoft Azure Stack, including the Compute, Network, and Storage resource providers.

## Storage services
Storage services in the operating system on the physical host include:

 - **ACS Blob Service** Azure Consistent Storage Blob service, which provides blob and table storage services.

 - **SoFS** Scale-out File Server.

 - **ReFS CSV** Resilient File System Cluster Shared Volume.

 - **Virtual Disk**, **Storage Space**, and **Storage Spaces Direct** are the respective underlying storage technology in Windows Server to enable the Microsoft Azure Stack core storage resource provider.
