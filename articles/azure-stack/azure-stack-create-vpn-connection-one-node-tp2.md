# Create a Site-to-Site VPN connection between two Virtual Networks in different Azure Stack PoC Environments

## Overview


This article walks you through the steps to create a Site-to-Site
VPN Connection between two virtual networks in two separate Azure Stack
Proof-of-Concept (POC) environments. The purpose of this is to help
people who are evaluating Site-to-Site gateways understand how to set up
VPN connections between virtual networks in two different Azure Stack
deployments.  In the process of doing so, you will gain an understanding how VPN Gateways work in Azure Stack.

>[AZURE.NOTE] This document applies specifically to the Azure Stack TP2 POC.

### Connection diagram


Following is a diagram that shows what our configuration should look like
when we’re done.

![](media/azure-stack-create-vpn-connection-one-node-tp2/image1.png)

### Before you begin


To complete this configuration, you need the following
items so make sure you have these things before you get started.

-   Two Servers that meet the Azure Stack POC hardware requirements
    defined by the [Azure Stack Deployment
    Prerequisites](azure-stack-deploy.md),
    and the other prerequisites defined by that document.

-   The Azure Stack Technical Preview 2 Deployment Package.

## Deploying the POC environments


You will deploy two Azure Stack POC environments to
complete this configuration.

-   For each POC that you deploy, you can simply follow the deployment instructions
    detailed in the article [Deploy Azure Stack
    POC](azure-stack-run-powershell-script.md).
	We will refer to each POC environment in this document generically as POC1 and POC2.

## Configure Quotas for Compute, Network and Storage


You need to configure Quotas for Compute, Network and Storage so
that these services can be associated with a Plan and then an Offer that
tenants can subscribe to.

>[AZURE.NOTE] You need to do these steps for each Azure Stack POC
environment.

The experience to create Quotas for Services has changed from TP1. The
steps on how to create Quotas in TP2 can be found at
<http://aka.ms/mas-create-quotas>. You can accept the defaults for all
quota settings for this exercise.

## Create a Plan and Offer

[Plans](azure-stack-key-features.md) are
groupings of one or more services. As a provider, you can create plans
to offer to your tenants. In turn, your tenants subscribe to your offers
to use the plans and services they include.

>[AZURE.NOTE] You will need to perform these steps for each Azure Stack POC
environment.

1.  First create a Plan. To do this, you can follow the steps in the
    [Create a
    Plan](azure-stack-create-plan.md)
    online article.

2.  Create an Offer following the steps described in [Create an Offer in
    Azure
    Stack](azure-stack-create-offer.md).

3.  Log in to the Portal as a Tenant Administrator and [subscribe to the
    Offer you
    created](azure-stack-subscribe-plan-provision-vm.md.

## Create the Network Resources in POC 1


Now we are going to actually create the resources we need to set up
our configuration. The following steps illustrate what we’ll be doing. These
instructions will be showing how to create resources via the Portal, but
the same thing can be accomplished via PowerShell.

![](media/azure-stack-create-vpn-connection-one-node-tp2/image2.png)

### Log in as a tenant

A service administrator can log in as a tenant to test the plans,
offers, and subscriptions that their tenants might use. If you don’t
already have one, [Create a tenant
account](azure-stack-add-new-user-aad.md) before
you log in.

### Create the virtual network & VM subnet


1.  Log in using a tenant account.

2.  In the Azure portal, click the
    **New** icon.

     ![](media/azure-stack-create-vpn-connection-one-node-tp2/image3.png)
3.  Select **Networking** from the Marketplace menu.

4.  Click the **Virtual network** item on the menu.

5.  Click the **Create** button near the bottom of the resource
    description blade. Enter the following values into the appropriate
    fields according to this table.

    | **Field**             | **Value** |
    |----------------------- | ------ |
    | Name                  |vnet-01 |
    | Address space         | 10.0.10.0/23 |
    | Subnet name           | subnet-01 |
    | Subnet address range  | 10.0.10.0/24 |

6.  You should see the Subscription you created earlier populated in the
    **Subscription** field.

7.  For Resource Group, you can either create a new Resource Group or if
    you already have one, select Use existing.

8.  Verify the default location.

9.  Click the **Create** button.

### Create the Gateway Subnet


1.  Open the Virtual network resource you just created (Vnet-01) from
    the Dashboard.

2.  On the Settings blade, select Subnets

3.  Click the **Gateway Subnet** button to add a Gateway Subnet to
    the Virtual network.

     ![](media/azure-stack-create-vpn-connection-one-node-tp2/image4.png)
4.  The name of the Subnet is set to **GatewaySubnet** by default.
    Gateway subnets are special and must have this specific name in
    order to function properly.

5.  In the **Address range** field, enter **10.0.11.0/24**.

6.  Click on the **Create** button to create the Gateway subnet.

### Create the Virtual Network Gateway


1.  In the Azure portal, click on the
    **New** icon.

    ![](media/azure-stack-create-vpn-connection-one-node-tp2/image3.png)

2.  Select **Networking** from the Marketplace menu.

3.  Select **Virtual network gateway** from the list of
    network resources.

4.  Review the description and click **Create**.

5.  In the **Name** field type **GW1**.

6.  Click the **Virtual network** item to Choose a virtual network.
    Select **Vnet-01** from the list.

7.  Click the **Public IP address** menu item. When the Choose public
    IP address blade opens click on the Create new button.

8.  In the **Name** field, enter **GW1-PiP** and click **Ok.**

9.  The **Gateway type** should have **VPN** selected by default. Keep
    this setting.

10. The **VPN type** should have **Route-based** selected by default.
    Keep this setting.

11. Verify **Subscription** and **Location** are correct. You can pin
    the resource to the Dashboard if you like. Click **Create**.

### Create the Local Network Gateway

The Local Network Gateway resource is a little weird in our scenario.
It’s the same resource you find in Azure, however in Azure it’s
typically meant to represent a physical, on-premise device you would
use to connect to the virtual network gateway in Azure. In our example,
both ends of the connection are actually virtual network gateways!

A way to think about this more generically is that the Local Network
Gateway resource is always meant to indicate the remote gateway at the
other end of the connection. Because of the way the POC was designed, we
actually need to provide the address of the external network
adapter on the NAT VM of the other POC as the Public IP Address of the
Local Network Gateway. We will then create NAT mappings on the NAT VM to
make sure that both ends are connected properly.

### Get the IP address of the external Adapter of the NAT VM

1.  Log in to the Azure Stack physical machine for POC2.

2.  [Windows Key]+ R to open the **Run** menu and type
    **mstsc** and hit enter.

3.  In the **Computer** field enter the name **MAS-BGPNAT01** and click
    the **Connect** button.

4.  Click the Start Menu and right-click on PowerShell and select
    **Run As Administrator**.

5.  Type **IPConfig /all**.

6.  Find the Ethernet Adapter that is connected to your on-premise
    network, and take note of the IPv4 address bound to that adapter. In
    my environment, it’s **10.16.167.195** but yours will be
    something different.

7.  Record this address. This is what we will use as the Public IP
    Address of the Local Network Gateway resource we create in POC1.

### Create the Local Network Gateway Resource

1.  Log in to the Azure Stack physical machine for POC1.

2.  In the **Computer** field, enter the name **MAS-CON01** and click the
    **Connect** button.

3.  In the Azure portal, click the **New** icon.

    ![](media/azure-stack-create-vpn-connection-one-node-tp2/image3.png)

4.  Select **Networking** from the Marketplace menu.

5.  Select **local network gateway** from the list of resources.

6.  In the **Name** field enter **POC2-GW**.

7.  We don’t know the IP address of our other Gateway yet, but that’s ok
    because we can come back and change it later. For now, enter
    **10.16.167.195** in the **IP address field**.

8.  In the **Address Space** field enter the address space of the Vnet
    that we will be creating in POC2. This is going to be
    **10.0.20.0/23** so enter that value.

9.  Verify that your **Subscription**, **Resource Group** and
    **location** are all correct and click **Create**.

### Create the Connection


1.  In the Azure portal, click the
    **New** icon.

     ![](media/azure-stack-create-vpn-connection-one-node-tp2/image3.png)

2.  Select **Networking** from the Marketplace menu.

3.  Select **Connection** from the list of resources.

4.  In the **Basic** settings blade, choose **Site-to-site (IPSec)** as
    the **Connection type**.

5.  Select the **Subscription**, **Resource Group** and **Location** and
    click **Ok**.

6.  In the **Settings** blade, choose the **Virtual Network Gateway**
    (**GW1**) you created earlier.

7.  Choose the **local** **Network Gateway** (**POC2-GW**) you
    created earlier.

8.  In the **Connection Name** field, enter **POC1-POC2**.

9.  In the **Shared Key (PSK)** field enter **12345**. Click **Ok**.

### Create a VM


In order to validate data traveling through the VPN Connection, you
need VMs to send and receive data in each POC. Let’s create a VM in
POC1 now and put it on our VM subnet in our virtual network.

1. In the Azure portal, click on the
    **New** icon.

     ![](media/azure-stack-create-vpn-connection-one-node-tp2/image3.png)

2.  Select **Virtual Machines** from the Marketplace menu.

3.  In the list of virtual machine images, select the **Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter** image.

4.  On the **Basics** blade, in the **Name** field enter the value
    **VM01**.

5.  Enter a valid User name and password. You’ll use this account to log
    in to the VM after it has been created.

6.  Provide a **Subscription**, **Resource Group** and **Location** and
    then click **Ok**.

7.  On the **Size** blade, choose a VM size for this instance and then
    click **Select**.

8.  On the Settings blade, you can accept the defaults, just make sure
    that the Virtual network selected is **VNET-01** and the Subnet is
    set to **10.0.10.0/24**. Click **Ok**.

9.  Review the settings on the **Summary** blade and click **Ok**.

    then click **Ok**.

7.  On the **Size** blade, choose a VM size for this instance and then
    click **Select**.

8.  On the Settings blade, you can accept the defaults, just make sure
    that the Virtual network selected is **VNET-02** and the Subnet is
    set to **20.0.0.0/24**. Click **Ok**.

9.  Review the settings on the **Summary** blade and click **Ok**.

## Configure the NAT VM in each POC for gateway traversal


Because the POC was designed to be self-contained and isolated from the
network on which the physical host is deployed, the “External” VIP network
that the gateways are connected to is not actually external, but instead
is hidden behind a router doing Network Address Translation (NAT). The
router is actually a Windows Server VM (**MAS-BGPNAT01**) running the
Routing and Remote Access Services (RRAS) role in the POC
infrastructure. We need to configure NAT on the MAS-BGPNAT01 VM to allow
the Site-to-Site VPN Connection to connect on both ends.

>[AZURE.NOTE] This configuration is required for POC environments only.

### Configure NAT


You need to follow these steps in BOTH POC environments.

1.  Log in to the Azure Stack physical machine for POC1.

2.  Press and hold [Windows Key] + R to open the **Run** menu and type
    **mstsc** and hit enter.

3.  In the **Computer** field enter the name **MAS-BGPNAT01** and click
    the **Connect** button.

4.  Click on the Start Menu and right-click on PowerShell and select
    **Run As Administrator**.

5.  Type **IPConfig /all**.

6.  Find the Ethernet Adapter that is connected to your on-premise
    network, and take note of the IPv4 address bound to that adapter. In
    my environment, it’s **10.16.169.131** (circled in red below), but
    yours will be something different.

     ![](media/azure-stack-create-vpn-connection-one-node-tp2/image16.png)

7.  Enter the following PowerShell command to designate the external NAT
    address for the ports that the IKE authentication. Remember to
    change the IP Address to the one that matches your environment.

        Add-NetNatExternalAddress -NatName BGPNAT -IPAddress 10.16.169.131 PortStart 499 -PortEnd 501

8. Next, we will create a static NAT mapping to map the external
    address to the Gateway Public IP Address to map the ISAKMP port 500
    for PHASE 1 of the IPSEC tunnel.

        Add-NetNatStaticMapping -NatName BGPNAT -Protocol UDP -ExternalIPAddress 10.16.169.131 -InternalIPAddress 192.168.102.1 -ExternalPort 500 -InternalPort 500

9.  Finally, we will need to do NAT traversal which uses port 4500 to
    successfully establish the complete IPEC tunnel over NAT devices.

         Add-NetNatStaticMapping -NatName BGPNAT -Protocol UDP -ExternalIPAddress 10.16.169.131 -InternalIPAddress 192.168.102.1 -ExternalPort 4500 -InternalPort 4500

10.  Repeat steps 1-9 in POC2.

## Test the connection


Now that the Site-to-Site connection has been established we should
validate that we can get traffic flowing through it. This task is simple
as it just involves logging in to one of the VMs we created in either POC
environment and pinging the VM we created in the other environment. To
ensure that we are putting the traffic through the Site-to-Site
connection, we want to make sure that we ping the Direct IP (DIP)
address of the VM on the remote subnet, not the VIP. To do this, we will
need to find out what the address is on the other end of our connection.

### Log in to the tenant VM in POC1


1.  Log in to the Azure Stack physical machine for POC1, and Log in to the Portal using a tenant account.

3.  Click the **Virtual Machines** icon in the left navigation bar.

4.  Find **VM01** that you created earlier in the list of VMs and click
    on it.

5. On the blade for the virtual machine
    click **Connect**.

	 ![](media/azure-stack-create-vpn-connection-one-node-tp2/image17.png)

6.  Open a Command Prompt from inside the VM and type **IPConfig /all**.

7.  Find the **IPv4 Address** in the output and take note of it. This is
    the address you will ping from POC2. In this environment, the
    address is **10.0.10.4**, but in your environment it might
    be different. It should however fall within the **10.0.10.0/24**
    subnet that was created earlier.

### Log in to the tenant VM in POC2

1.  Log in to the Azure Stack physical machine for POC2 and Log in to the portal using a tenant account.

3.  Click the **Virtual Machines** icon in the left navigation bar.

4.  Find **VM02** that you created earlier in the list of VMs and click
    on it.

5.  On the blade for the virtual machine
    click **Connect**.

	 ![](media/azure-stack-create-vpn-connection-one-node-tp2/image17.png)

6.  Open a Command Prompt from inside the VM and type **IPConfig /all**.

7.  You should see an IPv4 address that falls within 10.0.20.0/24. In my
    test lab, the address is 10.0.20.4, but yours might be different.

8.  Now from the VM in POC2 we want to ping the VM in POC1, through
    the tunnel. To do this we ping the DIP that we recorded from VM01.
    In my lab this is 10.0.10.4, but be sure to ping the address you
    found in your lab. You should see a result that looks like this.

     ![](media/azure-stack-create-vpn-connection-one-node-tp2/image16.png)

9.  A reply from the remote VM indicates a successful test! You can
    close the VM Connect window or, if you like, try doing some other
    data transfers to test your connection (like a file copy).

### Viewing data transfer statistics through the gateway connection


If you want to know how much data is passing through your Site-to-Site
connection, this information is available in the Connection blade. This test
is also another good way to verify that the ping you just sent actually
went through the VPN connection.

1.  While still logged in to **ClientVM** in POC2, Log in to the
    **Microsoft Azure Stack POC Portal** using your tenant account.

2.  Click the **Browse** menu item and select **Connections**.

3.  Click the **POC2-POC1** connection in the list.

4.  On the connection blade, you can see statistics for Data in and
    Data out. In the picture below you see some larger numbers than just
    ping would account for. That’s because we did some file transfers
    as well. You should see some non-zero values there.

     ![](media/azure-stack-create-vpn-connection-one-node-tp2/image20.png)
