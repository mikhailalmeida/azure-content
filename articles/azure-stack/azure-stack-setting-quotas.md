# Set quotas in Azure Stack

Quotas define the limits of resources that a tenant subscription
can provision or consume. For example, a quota might allow a tenant to
create up to five VMs. To add a service to a plan, the
administrator must configure the quota settings for that service.

Quotas are configurable per service and per location, enabling administrators to provide granular control over the resource
consumption. Administrators can create one or more quota
resources and associate them with plans, which means they can provide
differentiated offerings for their services. Quotas for a given service can be created
from the **Resource Provider** administration blade for that service.

A tenant that subscribes to an offer that contains multiple
plans can use all resources that are available in each plan.

## To create an IaaS quota

1.  In a browser, go to
    [https://portal.azurestack.local](https://portal.azurestack.local/).

    Sign in to the Azure Stack portal as an administrator (by using the credentials that you provided during deployment).

2.  Select **New**, and then select **Quota**.

3.  Select the first service for which you want to create a quota. For an IaaS quota, follow these steps for the Compute, Network, and Storage services.
In this example, we first create a quota for the Compute service. In the **Namespace** list, select the **Microsoft.Compute.Admin** namespace.

4.  Choose the location where the quota is defined (for example, 'local').

5.  On the **Quota Settings** item, it says **Set the
    Capacity of Quota**. Click this item to configure the quota settings.

6.  On the **Set Quotas** blade, you see all the Compute resources for which
    you can configure limits. Each type has a default
    value that's associated with it. You can change these values or you can select the **Ok** button at the bottom of the blade to accept
    the defaults.

7.  After you have configured the values and clicked **Ok**, the **Quota
    Settings** item appears as **Configured**. Click **Ok** to
    create the **Quota** resource.

    You should see a notification indicating that the quota resource is
    being created.

8.   After the quota set has been successfully created, you receive a second notification. The Compute service quota is now ready to be associated with a plan. Repeat these steps with the Network and Storage services, and you are ready to create an IaaS plan!

## Compute quota types

|**Type**                    |**Default value**| **Description**|
|--------------------------- | ------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Max number of virtual machines   |50|The maximum number of virtual machines that a subscription can create in this location. |
|Max number of virtual machine cores              |100|The maximum number of cores that a subscription can create in this location (for example, an A3 VM has four cores).|
|Max amount of virtual machine memory (GB)         |150|The maximum amount of RAM that can be provisioned in megabytes (for example, an A1 VM consumes 1.75 GB of RAM).|
