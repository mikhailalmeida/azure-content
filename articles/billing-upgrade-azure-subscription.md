You can upgrade your [Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) or [Microsoft Imagine](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0144p/) subscription to [Pay-As-You-Go](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/) from the Azure Account Portal. 

1. Sign in to the [Azure Account Portal](https://account.windowsazure.com/subscriptions) and navigate to the **subscriptions** tab.

When you upgrade Free Trial Pay-As-You-Go, any benefits left over from your Free Trial like the 30-day limit or $200 credit would continue until one of them is exhausted. The subscription upgrade happens afterwards.
