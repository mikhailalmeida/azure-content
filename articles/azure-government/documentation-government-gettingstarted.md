#  Getting Started with Azure Government

##  General Guidance for Customers

Most of the technical content that is available currently assumes that applications are being developed for the Global Service rather than for Microsoft Azure Government, itâ€™s important for you to ensure that developers are aware of key differences for applications developed to be hosted in Azure Government.

- First, there are services and feature differences, this means that certain features that are in specific regions of the Global Service may not be available in Azure Government.

- Second, for features that are offered in Azure Government, there are configuration differences from the Global Service.  Therefore, you should review your sample code, configurations and steps to ensure that you are building and executing within the Azure Government Cloud Services environment.

- Third, you should refer to the Azure Government Technical services documentation available from this site for information that identifies the Azure Government boundary and customer regulated/controlled data guidance and best practices.
