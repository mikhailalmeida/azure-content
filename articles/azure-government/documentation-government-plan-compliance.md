## Blueprint Customer Responsibilities Matrix:  Streamlining ATO processes

The Azure Blueprint program, allows customers to access documentation to assist their agency or system-specific authorization to operate (ATO) processes. This article provides a deeper look at the Azure Blueprint Customer Responsibilities Matrix (CRM) and how security personnel can leverage this document.

The Azure Blueprint CRM is designed for utility. It is a spreadsheet format that defines ONLY the control requirements where the customer building in Azure must implement the security control.

>[AZURE.NOTE] Within the context of Azure Blueprint, "customer" references the organization building directly within the Azure IaaS/PaaS environment. Azure customers could include third-party ISVs building on behalf of government or government agencies building directly on Azure.

The CRM provides the explicit <a href="http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r4.pdf"> NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 </a> controls that include a customer responsibility. This includes controls that are fully the responsibility of the customer, as well as controls that have a shared responsibility between the customer and Azure. Controls are broken down to the granularity of control sub requirements to be as explicit as possible.

For example, AC-1 requires access control  policies and procedures be documented for the system seeking ATO. For this control, Azure has internal policies and procedures regarding access control mechanisms used to manage the Azure Infrastructure and Platform. Customers must also create their own Access Control policies and procedures used within their specific system built on Azure. The CRM documents control parts AC-1a, which requires the policies and procedures to include specific content, as well as AC-1b, which requires customers to review and update these documents on at least an annual basis. 

For access to the CRM as well as the Azure Blueprint System Security Plan Template, please e-mail AzureBlueprint@microsoft.com.

We value any feedback on the CRM as it is pivotal to our iteration of the document to make it as effective as possible in streamlining customer ATO processes.
