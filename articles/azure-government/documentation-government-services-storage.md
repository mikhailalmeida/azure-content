| Data entered, stored, and processed within an Azure Storage product can contain export controlled data. Static authenticators, such as passwords and smartcard PINs for access to Azure platform components. Private keys of certificates used to manage Azure platform components. Other security information/secrets, such as certificates, encryption keys, master keys, and storage keys stored in Azure services. | Azure Storage metadata is not permitted to contain export controlled data. This metadata includes all configuration data entered when creating and maintaining your storage product.  Do not enter Regulated/controlled data into the following fields:  Resource groups, Deployment names, Resource names, Resource tags
