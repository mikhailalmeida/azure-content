- [Running Windows VMs for an N-tier architecture on Azure](guidance-compute-n-tier-vm.md)

This article outlines a set of proven practices for running Linux virtual machines (VMs) for an application with an N-tier architecture. It builds on the article [Running multiple VMs on Azure][multi-vm].

> [AZURE.NOTE] Azure has two different deployment models: [Resource Manager][resource-manager-overview] and classic. This article uses Resource Manager, which Microsoft recommends for new deployments.

## Architecture diagram

There are variations of N-tier architectures. For the most part, the differences shouldn't matter for the purposes of these recommendations. This article assumes a typical 3-tier web app:

- **Web tier.** Handles incoming HTTP requests. Responses are returned through this tier.

- **Business tier.** Implements business processes and other functional logic for the system.

- **Database tier.** Provides persistent data storage, using Apache Cassandra for high availability.

> A Visio document that includes this architecture diagram is available for download at the [Microsoft download center][visio-download]. This diagram is on the "Compute - multi tier (Linux) page.

![[0]][0]

- **Availability Sets.** Create an [Availability Set][azure-availability-sets] for each tier, and provision at least two VMs in each tier. This approach is required to reach the availability [SLA][vm-sla] for VMs.

- **Subnets.** Create a separate subnet for each tier. Specify the address range and subnet mask using [CIDR] notation. 

- **Load balancers.** Use an [Internet-facing load balancer][load-balancer-external] to distribute incoming Internet traffic to the web tier, and an [internal load balancer][load-balancer-internal] to distribute network traffic from the web tier to the business tier.

- **Jumpbox**. A _jumpbox_, also called a [bastion host], is a VM on the network that administrators use to connect to the other VMs. The jumpbox has an NSG that allows remote traffic only from whitelisted public IP addresses. The NSG should permit secure shell (SSH) traffic.

- **Monitoring**. Monitoring software such as [Nagios], [Zabbix], or [Icinga] can give you insight into response time, VM uptime, and the overall health of your system. Install the monitoring software on a VM that's placed in a separate management subnet.

- **NSGs**. Use [network security groups][nsg] (NSGs) to restrict network traffic within the VNet. For example, in the 3-tier architecture shown here, the database tier does not accept traffic from the web front end, only from the business tier and the management subnet.

- **Apache Cassandra database**. Provides high availability at the data tier, by enabling replication and failover.

## Recommendations

Azure offers many different resources and resource types, so this reference architecture can be provisioned many different ways. We have provided an Azure Resource Manager template to install the reference architecture that follows these recommendations. If you choose to create your own reference architecture follow these recommendations unless you have a specific requirement that a recommendation does not fit.

### VNet / Subnets

When you create the VNet, allocate enough address space for the subnets you will need. Specify the VNet address range and subnet mask using [CIDR] notation. Use an address space that falls within the standard [private IP address blocks][private-ip-space], which are 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16.

Choose an address range that does not overlap with your on-premise network, in case you need to set up a gateway between the VNet and your on-premise network later. Once you create the VNet, you can't change the address range.

Design subnets with functionality and security requirements in mind. All VMs within the same tier or role should go into the same subnet, which can be a security boundary. For more information about designing VNets and subnets, see [Plan and design Azure Virtual Networks][plan-network].

For each subnet, specify the address space for the subnet in CIDR notation. For example, '10.0.0.0/24' creates a range of 256 IP addresses. (VMs can use 251 of these; five are reserved. See the [Virtual Network FAQ][vnet faq].) Make sure the address ranges don't overlap across subnets.

### Load balancers

The external load balancer distributes Internet traffic to the web tier. Create a public IP address for this load balancer. See [Creating an Internet-facing load balancer][lb-external-create].

The internal load balancer distributes network traffic from the web tier to the business tier. To give this load balancer a private IP address, create a frontend IP configuration and associate it with the subnet for the business tier. See [Get started creating an Internal load balancer][lb-internal-create].

### Cassandra

We recommend [DataStax Enterprise][datastax] for production use, but these recommendations apply to any Cassandra edition. For more information on running DataStax in Azure, see [DataStax Enterprise Deployment Guide for Azure][cassandra-in-azure]. 

Put the VMs for a Cassandra cluster in an availability set, to ensure that the Cassandra replicas are distributed across multiple fault domains and upgrade domains. For more information about fault domains and upgrade domains, see [Manage the availability of virtual machines][availability-sets-manage]. 

Configure 3 fault domains (the maximum) per availability set. 

Configure 18 upgrade domains per availability set. This gives you the maximum number of upgrade domains than can still be distributed evenly across the fault domains.   

Configure nodes in rack-aware mode. Map fault domains to racks in the `cassandra-rackdc.properties` file.

You don't need a load balancer in front of the cluster. The client connects directly to a node in the cluster.

### Jumpbox

Place the jumpbox in the same VNet as the other VMs, but in a separate management subnet.

Create a [public IP address] for the jumpbox.

Use a small VM size for the jumpbox, such as Standard A1.

Configure the NSGs for the web tier, business tier, and database tier subnets to allow administrative (SSH) traffic to pass through from the management subnet.

To secure the jumpbox, create an NSG and apply it to the jumpbox subnet. Add an NSG rule that allows SSH connections only from a whitelisted set of public IP addresses.

The NSG can be attached either to the subnet or to the jumpbox NIC. In this case, we recommend attaching it to the NIC, so SSH traffic is permitted only to the jumpbox, even if you add other VMs to the same subnet.

Do not allow SSH access from the public Internet to the VMs that run the application workload. Instead, all SSH access to these VMs must come through the jumpbox. An administrator logs into the jumpbox, and then logs into the other VM from the jumpbox. The jumpbox allows SSH traffic from the Internet, but only from known, whitelisted IP addresses.

## Availability considerations

Put each tier or VM role into a separate availability set. Don't put VMs from different tiers into the same availability set. 

At the database tier, having multiple VMs does not automatically translate into a highly available database. For a relational database, you will typically need to use replication and failover to achieve high availability.  

If you need higher availability than the [Azure SLA for VMs][vm-sla] provides, replicate the application across two regions and use Azure Traffic Manager for failover. For more information, see [Running Linux VMs in multiple regions for high availability][multi-dc].  

## Security considerations

Use NSG rules to restrict traffic between tiers. For example, in the 3-tier architecture shown above, the web tier does not communicate directly with the database tier. To enforce this, the database tier should block incoming traffic from the web tier subnet.  

  1. Create an NSG and associate it to the database tier subnet.

  2. Add a rule that denies all inbound traffic from the VNet. (Use the `VIRTUAL_NETWORK` tag in the rule.) 

  3. Add a rule with a higher priority that allows inbound traffic from the business tier subnet. This rule overrides the previous rule, and allows the business tier to talk to the database tier.

  4. Add a rule that allows inbound traffic from within the database tier subnet itself. This rule allows communication between VMs in the database tier, which is needed for database replication and failover.

  5. Add a rule that allows SSH traffic from the jumpbox subnet. This rule lets administrators connect to the database tier from the jumpbox.

  > [AZURE.NOTE] An NSG has [default rules][nsg-rules] that allow any inbound traffic from within the VNet. These rules can't be deleted, but you can override them by creating higher-priority rules.

Consider adding a network virtual appliance (NVA) to create a DMZ between the public Internet and the Azure virtual network. NVA is a generic term for a virtual appliance that can perform network-related tasks such as firewall, packet inspection, auditing, custom routing, or a variety of other operations. For more information, see [Implementing a DMZ between Azure and the Internet][dmz].

## Scalability considerations

The load balancers distribute network traffic to the web and business tiers. Scale horizontally by adding new VM instances. Note that you can scale the web and business tiers independently, based on load. To reduce possible complications caused by the need to maintain client affinity, the VMs in the web tier should be stateless. The VMs hosting the business logic should also be stateless.

## Manageability considerations

Simplify management of the entire system by using centralized administration tools such as [Azure Automation][azure-administration], [Microsoft Operations Management Suite][operations-management-suite], [Chef][chef], or [Puppet][puppet]. These tools can consolidate diagnostic and health information captured from multiple VMs to provide an overall view of the system.

## Solution Deployment

A deployment for a reference architecture that implements these recommendations is available on [Github][github-folder]. This reference architecture includes a web tier, business tier, and a data tier.

1. Click the button below.  
[!["Deploy To Azure"][1]][2]

2. Once the link has opened in the Azure portal, enter the follow values: 
  - The **Resource group** name is already defined in the parameter file, so select **Create New** and enter `ra-ntier-sql-network-rg` in the text box.
  - Select the region from the **Location** drop down box.
  - Do not edit the **Template Root Uri** or the **Parameter Root Uri** text boxes.
  - Review the terms and conditions, then click the **I agree to the terms and conditions stated above** checkbox.
  - Click on the **Purchase** button.

3. Check Azure portal notification for a message the deployment is complete.

4. The parameter files include a hard-coded administrator user names and passwords, and it is strongly recommended that you immediately change both on all the VMs. Click on each VM in the Azure Portal then click on **Reset password** in the **Support + troubleshooting** blade. Select **Reset password** in the **Mode** dropdown box, then select a new **User name** and **Password**. Click the **Update** button to persist the new user name and password.

## Next steps

To achieve high availability for this reference architecture, we recommend [deploying to multiple regions][multi-dc].
