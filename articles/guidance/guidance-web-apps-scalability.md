# Improving scalability in a web application

[AZURE.INCLUDE [pnp-RA-branding](../../includes/guidance-pnp-header-include.md)]

This article shows a recommended architecture for improving scalability and performance in a web application running on Microsoft Azure. The architecture builds on [Azure reference architecture: Basic web application][basic-web-app]. The recommendations and considerations from that article apply to this architecture as well.

## Architecture diagram

![[0]][0]

The architecture has the following components:

- **Resource group**. A [resource group][resource-group] is a logical container for Azure resources.

- **[Web app][app-service-web-app]** and **[API app][app-service-api-app]**. A typical modern application might include both a website and one or more RESTful web APIs. A web API might be consumed by browser clients through AJAX, by native client applications, or by server-side applications. For considerations on designing web APIs, see [API design guidance][api-guidance].    

- **WebJob**. Use [Azure WebJobs][webjobs] to run long-running tasks in the background. WebJobs can run on a schedule, continously, or in response to a trigger, such as putting a message on a queue. A WebJob runs as a background process in the context of an App Service app.

- **Queue**. In the architecture shown here, the application queues background tasks by putting a message onto an [Azure Queue Storage][queue-storage] queue to trigger a function in the WebJob. Service Bus queues can also be used. For a comparison, see [Azure Queues and Service Bus queues - compared and contrasted][queues-compared].

- **Cache**. Store semi-static data in [Azure Redis Cache][azure-redis].  

- **CDN**. Use [Azure Content Delivery Network][azure-cdn] (CDN) to cache publicly available content for lower latency and faster delivery of content.

- **Data storage.** Use [Azure SQL Database][sql-db] for relational data. For non-relational data consider a NoSQL store, such as Azure Table Storage or [DocumentDB][documentdb].

- **Azure Search**. Use [Azure Search][azure-search] to add search functionality such as search suggestions, fuzzy search, and language-specific search. Azure Search is typically used in conjunction with another data store if the primary data store requires strict consistency. In this approach, store authoritative data in the other data store and the search index in Azure Search. Azure Search can also be used to consolidate a single search index from multiple data stores.  

- **Email/SMS**. Use a third-party service such as SendGrid or Twilio to send email or SMS messages instead of building this functionality directly into the application.

## Recommendations

You might have additional or differing requirements from the architecture described here. You can use the items in this section as a starting point for considering how to customize the architecture for your own system.

### App Service apps

We recommend creating the web application and the web API as separate App Service apps. This design lets you run them in separate App Service plans so they can be scaled independently. If you don't need that level of scalability initially, you can instead deploy the apps into the same plan and move them into separate plans later if necessary.

> [AZURE.NOTE] For the Basic, Standard, and Premium plans, you are billed for the VM instances in the plan, not per app. See [App Service Pricing][app-service-pricing]

If you intend to use the *Easy Tables* or *Easy APIs* features of App Service Mobile Apps, create a separate App Service app for this purpose.  These features rely on a specific application framework to enable them.

### WebJobs

Consider deploying resource intensive WebJobs to an empty App Service app within a separate App Service plan. This provides dedicated instances for the WebJob. See [Background jobs guidance][webjobs-guidance].  

### Cache

You can improve performance and scalability by using [Azure Redis Cache][azure-redis]. Consider using Redis Cache for:

- Semi-static transaction data.

- Session state.

- HTML output. This can be useful in applications that render complex HTML output.

For more detailed guidance on designing a caching strategy, see [Caching guidance][caching-guidance].

### CDN

Use [Azure CDN][azure-cdn] to cache static content. CDN caches content at an *edge server* that is geographically close to the user, resulting in less latency. CDN can also reduce load on the application by handling traffic on behalf of the application.

If your app consists mostly of static pages, consider using [CDN to cache the entire app][cdn-app-service]. Otherwise, put static content such as images, CSS, and HTML files, into [Azure Storage and use CDN to cache those files][cdn-storage-account].

> [AZURE.NOTE] Azure CDN cannot serve content that requires authentication.

For more detailed guidance, see [Content Delivery Network (CDN) guidance][cdn-guidance].

### Storage

Modern applications often process large amounts of data. In order to scale for the cloud, it's important to choose the right storage type. Here are some baseline recommendations.  For more detailed guidance, see [Assessing Data Store Capabilities for Polyglot Persistence Solutions][polyglot-storage].

What you want to store | Example | Recommended storage
--- | --- | ---
Files | Images, documents, PDFs | Azure Blob Storage
Key/Value pairs | User profile data looked up by user ID | Azure Table Storage
Short messages intended to trigger further processing | Order requests | Azure Queue Storage, Service Bus Queue, or Service Bus Topic
Non-relational data with a flexible schema requiring basic querying | Product catalog | Document database, such as Azure DocumentDB, MongoDB, or Apache CouchDB
Relational data requiring richer query support, strict schema, and/or strong consistency | Product inventory | Azure SQL Database

## Scalability considerations

A primary benefit of implementing your application in Azure App Service is the ability to scale your application based on load. Here are some considerations you should keep in mind when planning to scale your application.

### App Service app

If your solution includes several App Service apps, consider deploying them to separate App Service plans. This approach enables you to scale them independently because they run on separate instances. For more information about scaling out, see the [Scalability considerations][basic-web-app-scalability] section in the [Basic web application architecture][basic-web-app].

Similarly, consider putting a WebJob into its own plan so that background tasks don't run on the same instances that handle HTTP requests.  

### SQL Database

Increase scalability of a SQL database by *sharding* the database. Sharding refers to partitioning the database horizontally. Sharding allows you to scale out the database horizontally using [Elastic Database tools][sql-elastic]. Some of the benefits of sharing are better transaction throughput and  faster running queries over a subset of the data.

### Azure Search

Azure Search removes the overhead of performing complex data searches from the primary data store, and it can scale to handle load. See [Scale resource levels for query and indexing workloads in Azure Search][azure-search-scaling].

## Security considerations

This section lists security considerations that are specific to the Azure services described in this article. It's not a complete list of security best practices. For some additional security considerations, see [Secure an app in Azure App Service][app-service-security].

### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

If you create a website and web API as separate apps, the website cannot make client-side AJAX calls to the API unless you enable CORS.

> [AZURE.NOTE] Browser security prevents a web page from making AJAX requests to another domain. This restriction is called the same-origin policy, and prevents a malicious site from reading sentitive data from another site. CORS is a W3C standard that allows a server to relax the same-origin policy and allow some cross-origin requests while rejecting others.

App Services has built-in support for CORS, without needing to write any application code. See [Consume an API app from JavaScript using CORS][cors]. Add the website to the list of allowed origins for the API.

### SQL Database encryption

Use [Transparent Data Encryption][sql-encryption] if you need to encrypt data at rest in the database. This feature performs real-time encryption and decryption of an entire database (including backups and transaction log files) and requires no changes to the application. Encryption does add some latency so it's a good practice to separate the data that must be secure into its own database and enable encryption only for that database.  

## Next steps

- For higher availability, deploy the application in more than one region and use [Azure Traffic Manager][tm] for failover. For more information, see [Azure reference architecture: Web application with high availability][web-app-multi-region].
