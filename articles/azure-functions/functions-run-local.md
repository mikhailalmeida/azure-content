# How to code and test Azure functions locally 

> [AZURE.NOTE] Azure Functions is currently in preview, and the overall experience including tooling is still under rapid development. The easiest way to run the Azure Functions host locally is use the [Azure Functions CLI](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=832752) and install it from npm. Currently, only Windows is supported. Full documentation is coming soon. To provide feedback or file bugs on the Azure Functions CLI, please file an issue in the [azure-webjobs-sdk-script](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-script) GitHub repo.
