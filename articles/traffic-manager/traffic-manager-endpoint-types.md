# Traffic Manager endpoints

Microsoft Azure Traffic Manager allows you to control how network traffic is distributed to application deployments running in different datacenters. You configure each application deployment as an 'endpoint' in Traffic Manager. When Traffic Manager receives a DNS request, it chooses an available endpoint to return in the DNS response. Traffic manager bases the choice on the current endpoint status and the traffic-routing method. For more information, see [How Traffic Manager Works](traffic-manager-how-traffic-manager-works.md).

There are three types of endpoint supported by Traffic Manager:

- **Azure endpoints** are used for services hosted in Azure.
- **External endpoints** are used for services hosted outside Azure, either on-premises or with a different hosting provider.
- **Nested endpoints** are used to combine Traffic Manager profiles to create more flexible traffic-routing schemes to support the needs of larger, more complex deployments.

There is no restriction on how endpoints of different types are combined in a single Traffic Manager profile. Each profile can contain any mix of endpoint types.

The following sections describe each endpoint type in greater depth.

## Azure endpoints

Azure endpoints are used for Azure-based services in Traffic Manager. The following Azure resource types are supported:

- 'Classic' IaaS VMs and PaaS cloud services.
- Web Apps
- PublicIPAddress resources (which can be connected to VMs either directly or via an Azure Load Balancer). The publicIpAddress must have a DNS name assigned to be used in a Traffic Manager profile.

PublicIPAddress resources are Azure Resource Manager resources. They do not exist in the classic deployment model. Thus they are only supported in Traffic Manager's Azure Resource Manager experiences. The other endpoint types are supported via both Resource Manager and the classic deployment model.

When using Azure endpoints, Traffic Manager detects when a 'Classic' IaaS VM, cloud service, or a Web App is stopped and started. This status is reflected in the endpoint status. See [Traffic Manager endpoint monitoring](traffic-manager-monitoring.md#endpoint-and-profile-status) for details. When the underlying service is stopped, Traffic Manager does not perform endpoint health checks or direct traffic to the endpoint. No Traffic Manager billing events occur for the stopped instance. When the service is restarted, billing resumes and the endpoint is eligible to receive traffic. This detection does not apply to PublicIpAddress endpoints.

## External endpoints

External endpoints are used for services outside of Azure. For example, a service hosted on-premises or with a different provider. External endpoints can be used individually or combined with Azure Endpoints in the same Traffic Manager profile. Combining Azure endpoints with External endpoints enables various scenarios:

- In either an active-active or active-passive failover model, use Azure to provide increased redundancy for an existing on-premises application.
- To reduce application latency for users around the world, extend an existing on-premises application to additional geographic locations in Azure. For more information, see [Traffic Manager 'Performance' traffic routing](traffic-manager-routing-methods.md#performance-traffic-routing-method).
- Use Azure to provide additional capacity for an existing on-premises application, either continuously or as a 'burst-to-cloud' solution to meet a spike in demand.

In certain cases, it is useful to use External endpoints to reference Azure services (for examples, see the [FAQ](#faq)). In this case, health checks are billed at the Azure endpoints rate, not the External endpoints rate. However, unlike Azure endpoints, if you stop or delete the underlying service, health check billing continues until you disable or delete the endpoint in Traffic Manager.

## Nested endpoints

Nested endpoints combine multiple Traffic Manager profiles to create flexible traffic-routing schemes and support the needs of larger, complex deployments. With Nested endpoints, a 'child' profile is added as an endpoint to a 'parent' profile. Both the child and parent profiles can contain other endpoints of any type, including other nested profiles. For more information, see [nested Traffic Manager profiles](traffic-manager-nested-profiles.md).

## Web Apps as endpoints

Some additional considerations apply when configuring Web Apps as endpoints in Traffic Manager:

1. Only Web Apps at the 'Standard' SKU or above are eligible for use with Traffic Manager. Attempts to add a Web App of a lower SKU fail. Downgrading the SKU of an existing Web App results in Traffic Manager no longer sending traffic to that Web App.

2. When an endpoint receives an HTTP request, it uses the 'host' header in the request to determine which Web App should service the request. The host header contains the DNS name used to initiate the request, for example 'contosoapp.azurewebsites.net'. To use a different DNS name with your Web App, the DNS name must be registered as a custom domain name for the App. When adding a Web App endpoint as an Azure endpoint, the Traffic Manager profile DNS name is automatically registered for the App. This registration is automatically removed when the endpoint is deleted.

3. Each Traffic Manager profile can have at most one Web App endpoint from each Azure region. To work around for this constraint, you can configure a Web App as an External endpoint. For more information, see the [FAQ](#faq).

## Enabling and disabling endpoints

Disabling an endpoint in Traffic Manager can be useful to temporarily remove traffic from an endpoint that is in maintenance mode or being redeployed. Once the endpoint is running again, it can be re-enabled.

Endpoints can be enabled and disabled via the Traffic Manager portal, PowerShell, CLI or REST API, all of which are supported in both Resource Manager and the classic deployment model.

>[AZURE.NOTE] Disabling an Azure endpoint has nothing to do with its deployment state in Azure. An Azure service (such as a VM or Web App remains running and able to receive traffic even when disabled in Traffic Manager. Traffic can be addressed directly to the service instance rather than via the Traffic Manager profile DNS name. For more information, see [how Traffic Manager works](traffic-manager-how-traffic-manager-works.md).

The current eligibility of each endpoint to receive traffic depends on the following factors:

- The profile status (enabled/disabled)
- The endpoint status (enabled/disabled)
- The results of the health checks for that endpoint

For details, see [Traffic Manager endpoint monitoring](traffic-manager-monitoring.md#endpoint-and-profile-status).

>[AZURE.NOTE] Since Traffic Manager works at the DNS level, it is unable to influence existing connections to any endpoint. When an endpoint is unavailable, Traffic Manager directs new connections to another available endpoint. However, the host behind the disabled or unhealthy endpoint may continue to receive traffic via existing connections until those sessions are terminated. Applications should limit the session duration to allow traffic to drain from existing connections.

If all endpoints in a profile are disabled, or if the profile itself is disabled, then Traffic Manager sends an 'NXDOMAIN' response to a new DNS query.

## FAQ

### Can I use Traffic Manager with endpoints from multiple subscriptions?

Using endpoints from multiple subscriptions is not possible with Azure Web Apps. Azure Web Apps requires that any custom domain name used with Web Apps is only used within a single subscription. It is not possible to use Web Apps from multiple subscriptions with the same domain name.

For other endpoint types, it is possible to use Traffic Manager with endpoints from more than one subscription. How you configure Traffic Manager depends on whether you are using the classic deployment model or the Resource Manager experience.

- In Resource Manager, endpoints from any subscription can be added to Traffic Manager, so long as the person configuring the Traffic Manager profile has read access to the endpoint. These permissions can be granted using [Azure Resource Manager role-based access control (RBAC)](../active-directory/role-based-access-control-configure.md).
- In the classic deployment model interface, Traffic Manager requires that Cloud Services or Web Apps configured as Azure endpoints reside in the same subscription as the Traffic Manager profile. Cloud Service endpoints in other subscriptions can be added to Traffic Manager as 'external' endpoints. These external endpoints are billed as Azure endpoints, rather than the external rate.

### Can I use Traffic Manager with Cloud Service 'Staging' slots?

Yes. Cloud Service 'staging' slots can be configured in Traffic Manager as External endpoints. Health checks are still be charged at the Azure Endpoints rate. Because the External endpoint type is in use, changes to the underlying service are not picked up automatically. With external endpoints, Traffic Manager cannot detect when the Cloud Service is stopped or deleted. Therefore, the Traffic Manager continues billing for health checks until the endpoint is disabled or deleted.

### Does Traffic Manager support IPv6 endpoints?

Traffic Manager does not currently provide IPv6-addressible name servers. However, Traffic Manager can still be used by IPv6 clients connecting to IPv6 endpoints. A client does not make DNS requests directly to Traffic Manager. Instead, the client uses a recursive DNS service. An IPv6-only client sends requests to the recursive DNS service via IPv6. Then the recursive service should be able to contact the Traffic Manager name servers using IPv4.

Traffic Manager responds with the DNS name of the endpoint. To support an IPv6 endpoint, a DNS AAAA record pointing the endpoint DNS name to the IPv6 address must exist. Traffic Manager health checks only support IPv4 addresses. The service needs to expose an IPv4 endpoint on the same DNS name.

### Can I use Traffic Manager with more than one Web App in the same region?

Typically, Traffic Manager is used to direct traffic to applications deployed in different regions. However, it can also be used where an application has more than one deployment in the same region. The Traffic Manager Azure endpoints do not permit more than one Web App endpoint from the same Azure region to be added to the same Traffic Manager profile.

The following steps provide a workaround to this constraint:

1. Check that your endpoints are in different web app 'scale units'. A domain name must map to a single site in a given scale unit. Therefore, two Web Apps in the same scale unit cannot share a Traffic Manager profile.
2. Add your vanity domain name as a custom hostname to each Web App. Each Web App must be in a different scale unit. All Web Apps must belong to the same subscription.
3. Add one (and only one) Web App endpoint to your Traffic Manager profile, as an Azure endpoint.
4. Add each additional Web App endpoint to your Traffic Manager profile as an External endpoint. External endpoints can only be added using the Resource Manager deployment model.
5. Create a DNS CNAME record in your vanity domain that points to your Traffic Manager profile DNS name (<...>.trafficmanager.net).
6. Access your site via the vanity domain name, not the Traffic Manager profile DNS name.
