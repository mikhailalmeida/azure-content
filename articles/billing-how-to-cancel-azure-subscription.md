# Cancel your Azure subscription

Cancel your Azure subscription from the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/subscriptions). After you cancel the subscription, your access to Azure services and resources will end.

Before you cancel your subscription:

- Back up your data. For example, if you're storing data in Azure storage or SQL, download a copy. If you have a virtual machine, save an image of it locally.

- Shut down your services. Go to the [resources page in the management portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/?flight=1#blade/HubsExtension/Resources/resourceType/Microsoft.Resources%2Fresources), and **Stop** any running virtual machines, applications, or other services.

If you cancel a paid [Azure Support plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/), you will still be billed monthly for the rest of the 6-months term.

## Cancel subscription

1. Log on to the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/subscriptions) as the Account Administrator.

2. Under **Click a subscription to view details and usage**, select the subscription that you want to cancel.

5. Click ![checkbutton](./media/billing-how-to-cancel-azure-subscription/checkbutton.png) to close the dialog window and return to your subscription page.

After you cancel your subscription, we wait 90 days before permanently deleting your data in case you need to access it or change your mind. For more information, see [Microsoft Trust Center - How we manage your data](https://go.microsoft.com/fwLink/p/?LinkID=822930&clcid=0x409).

## Reactivate subscription

If you canceled your Pay-As-You-Go subscription accidentally, you can [reactivate it in the Accounts Center](billing-subscription-become-disable.md#how-to-re-enable-non-pay-as-you-go-subscriptions).
