# Discover custom machine learning modules in the Cortana Intelligence Gallery

[AZURE.INCLUDE [machine-learning-gallery-item-selector](../../includes/machine-learning-gallery-item-selector.md)]

## Custom modules for Machine Learning Studio

A number of
**[Custom Modules](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/customModules)**
are available in the Cortana Intelligence Gallery that expand the capabilities of Azure Machine Learning Studio. You can download these modules for use in your experiments so that you can develop even more advanced predictive analytics solutions.

## Discover

To browse for custom modules in the Gallery, open the [Gallery](http://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com), point your mouse at **More** at the top of the Gallery home page, and select **Custom Modules**.

![Select Custom Modules from the Gallery home page](media/machine-learning-gallery-custom-modules/select-custom-modules-in-gallery.png)

 The
**[Custom Modules](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/customModules)**
 page displays a list of the most popular
modules.
 Click **See all** to view all
custom modules.
 From this page you can browse all the
custom modules
 in the Gallery, or you can search by selecting filter criteria on the left of the page and entering search terms at the top.

### Comment and share

 Click any
custom module
 to open the
module's
 details page and read information about what the
module
 does and how to use it. On this page you can comment, provide feedback, or ask questions through the comments section. You can even share it with friends or colleagues using the share capabilities of LinkedIn or Twitter. You can also email a link to the
custom module
 to invite other users to view the page.

## Download

You can use any custom module in the Gallery in your own experiments.
There are two ways to get a copy of the module:

- **From the Gallery** - When you download a module from the Gallery, the module is added to the module palette in your workspace. You also get a sample experiment that gives you an example of how to use the module.

- **From within Machine Learning Studio** - You can import any custom module while you're working in Studio, and the module is added to the module palette in your workspace.

Once the custom module is in your module palette, it's available for you to use in any experiment in your workspace just like any other module:

1. Create a new experiment or open an existing one
2. In the module palette to the left of the experiment canvas, click **Custom** to expand the list of custom modules in your workspace

3. Select the module you imported and drag it to your experiment


### From the Gallery

To download a copy of a custom module from the Gallery:

1. Open the module's details page in the Gallery

2. Click **Open in Studio**

	![Open custom module from the Gallery](media\machine-learning-gallery-custom-modules\open-custom-module-from-gallery.png)

	Each custom module includes a sample experiment that demonstrates how to use the module. When you click **Open in Studio**, this sample experiment is loaded into your Machine Learning Studio workspace and opened (if you're not already signed in to Studio, you will be prompted to sign in using your Microsoft account before the experiment is copied to your workspace).

The custom module is copied to your workspace and placed in your module palette alongside all the other built-in or custom Studio modules. You can now use it like any other module in your workspace.

### From within Machine Learning Studio

You can also import the same custom modules from the Gallery while you're working in Machine Learning Studio:

1. In Machine Learning Studio, click **+NEW**

2. Select **Module** - a list of Gallery modules is displayed that you can choose from, or you can find a specific module using the search box

3. Point your mouse at a module and select **Import Module** (to see information about the module, select **View in Gallery** which takes you to the details page for the module in the Gallery)

	![Import custom module into Machine Learning Studio](media\machine-learning-gallery-custom-modules\add-custom-module-in-studio.png)

The custom module is copied to your workspace and placed in your module palette alongside all the other built-in or custom Studio modules. You can now use it like any other module in your workspace.
