# Discover experiments in the Cortana Intelligence Gallery

[AZURE.INCLUDE [machine-learning-gallery-item-selector](../../includes/machine-learning-gallery-item-selector.md)]

## Experiments for Machine Learning Studio

The Gallery contains a wide variety of
**[Experiments](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/experiments)**
that have been developed in [Azure Machine Learning Studio](https://studio.azureml.net). These range from quick proof-of-concept experiments that demonstrate a specific machine learning technique, to fully-developed solutions for complex machine learning problems.

> [AZURE.NOTE] An ***experiment*** is a canvas in Azure Machine Learning Studio that lets you construct a predictive analysis model by connecting together data with various analytical modules. You can try different ideas, do trial runs, and eventually publish your model as a web service in Azure. For an example of creating a simple experiment, see [Machine learning tutorial: Create your first experiment in Azure Machine Learning Studio](machine-learning-create-experiment.md). For a more complete walkthrough of creating a predictive analytics solution, see [Walkthrough: Develop a predictive analytics solution for credit risk assessment in Azure Machine Learning](machine-learning-walkthrough-develop-predictive-solution.md).

### Suggestions for publishing and for quality documentation

- While you can assume that the reader has prior data science experience, it still helps to simplify your language and explain things in detail wherever possible.

- Not all readers will be familiar with the Cortana Intelligence Suite, given that it's relatively new.
So provide enough information and step-by-step explanations to help readers navigate through your work.

- Visuals including experiment graphs or screenshots of data can be very helpful for readers to interpret and use your content the right way. See the [Publishing Guidelines and Examples collection](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Collection/Publishing-Guidelines-and-Examples-1) for more information on how to include images in your documentation.

- If you include a dataset in your experiment (it's not being imported through the Import Data module), it's part of your experiment and will get published to the Gallery. Therefore, ensure that the dataset you're publishing has appropriate licensing terms for sharing and downloading by anyone. Gallery contributions are covered under the Azure [Terms of Use](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/website-terms-of-use/).

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What are the image requirements when submitting or editing an image for my experiment?**

The images you submit along with your experiment will be used to create an experiment tile for your contribution. It's recommended that the images be < 500Kb in size, with an aspect ratio of 3:2. A resolution of 960x640 is recommended

**What happens to the dataset I used in the experiment? Does the dataset get published to the Gallery as well?**

If your dataset is part of your experiment and not being imported through the Import Data module, it's part of your experiment and gets published to the Gallery with your experiment. For this reason make sure that the dataset you're publishing with the experiment has the appropriate licensing terms that allow sharing and downloading by anyone.

**I have an experiment that uses an Import Data module to pull data from HDInsight or SQL. It uses my credentials to retrieve the data. How can I publish such an experiment and be assured that my credentials will not be shared?**

At this time we do not allow publishing of experiments that use credentials.

**How do I enter multiple tags?**

After you enter a tag, press the tab key to enter another tag.
