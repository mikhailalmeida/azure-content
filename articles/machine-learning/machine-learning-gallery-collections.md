# Discover and share collections in the Cortana Intelligence Gallery

[AZURE.INCLUDE [machine-learning-gallery-item-selector](../../includes/machine-learning-gallery-item-selector.md)]

## Collections

A
**[Collection](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/collections)**
allows you to group together experiments, APIs, and other Gallery items that address a specific solution or concept. These can be grouped together for later reference, use, or sharing.

## Discover

To browse for collections in the Gallery, open the [Gallery](http://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com), point your mouse at **More** at the top of the Gallery home page, and select **Collections**.

![Select Collections from the Gallery home page](media/machine-learning-gallery-collections/select-collections-in-gallery.png)

 The
**[Collections](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/collections)**
 page displays a list of the most recently added and most popular
collections.
 Click **See all** to view all
collections.
 From this page you can browse all the
collections
 in the Gallery, or you can search by selecting filter criteria on the left of the page and entering search terms at the top.

 Click any
collection
 to open the
collection's
 details page and read more information about it.
 On this page you can comment, provide feedback, or ask questions through the comments section. You can even share it with friends or colleagues using the share capabilities of LinkedIn or Twitter. You can also email a link to the
experiment
 to invite other users to view the page.

## Contribute

You can create a collection that contains items that you own or items that have been contributed by the community. They can be any Gallery items that address a specific solution or concept

For example, you can use a collection to group together items on a specific topic, or you can group together a multi-step experiment that solves a complex problem.
The initial collections contributed by Microsoft consist of multi-step machine learning experiment templates for solving real world problems, such as online fraud detection, text classification, retail forecasting, and predictive maintenance.
