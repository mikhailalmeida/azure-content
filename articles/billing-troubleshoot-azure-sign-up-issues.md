# I can't sign up for Azure

If you can't sign up for Azure, there are several things you can check to troubleshoot the issue.

## No text messages or calls during sign up account verification 

- Verify that your phone number can receive SMS.
- Double check the phone number you entered, including the country code selection in the dropdown menu.
- Be sure your phone can receive text messages (SMS) if you use "Send text message," or phone calls if you choose the "Call me" alternative.
- If you use a mobile phone, be sure that you have a good phone connection.
- Wait up to four minutes to let the messaging system deliver your text code if you choose "Send text message."
- When you receive the text message, insert the code in the text box, and click the verification button to proceed.

### Suggestions

- If you do not receive text messages (SMS) in your phone, use the "call me" alternate verification method.
- Use another phone number if the phone verification step fails using both SMS and "Call me" methods.
- A VOIP phone number cannot be used for the phone verification process.

>[AZURE.NOTE] You can change your preferred phone number later by [updating your profile information](billing-how-to-change-azure-account-profile.md).

## Credit card declined or not accepted

Make sure that the payment method you are using at sign-up is supported for Azure activations or payments.

- Virtual and prepaid credit/debit cards are not accepted.
- Accepted credit/debit card providers vary based on account country.

### Suggestion

For common causes of sign-up issues using a credit or debit card, see [Your debit card or credit card is declined at Azure sign up](billing-credit-card-fails-during-azure-sign-up.md).

## Can’t activate Azure benefit plan like MSDN, BizSpark, BizSparkPlus, or MPN

Verify through your benefit program channel if you are eligible for the chosen plan:

- MSDN
	- Verify your eligibility status in your [MSDN account page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/manage/default.aspx).
	- If you cannot verify your status, contact the [MSDN Subscriptions Customer Service Centers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/contactus.aspx)
- MPN
	- Sign in to the [MPN portal](https://mspartner.microsoft.com/en/us/Pages/Locale.aspx) and verify your eligibility status. If you have the appropriate [Cloud Platform Competencies](https://mspartner.microsoft.com/en/us/pages/membership/cloud-platform-competency.aspx), you may be eligible for additional benefits.
	- If you cannot verify your status, contact [MPN support](https://mspartner.microsoft.com/en/us/Pages/Support/Premium/contact-support.aspx).
- Bizpark
	- Sign in to the [BizSpark portal](https://www.microsoft.com/bizspark/default.aspx#start-two) and verify your eligibility status for BizSpark and BizSpark Plus.
	- If you cannot verify your status, contact Bizspark Support sending an email to [Contact BizSpark Team](mailto:bizspark@microsoft.com?subject=BizSpark%20Support&body=Thank%20you%20for%20contacting%20BizSpark.%20Please%20provide%20as%20much%20of%20the%20following%20information%20as%20possible,%20as%20it%20will%20help%20expedite%20our%20response%20to%20you.%0aContact%20name:%0aStartup%20name:%0aMicrosoft%20Account/Live%20ID:%0aSpecific%20description%20of%20issue%20experienced%20or%20question:%0a%0aThank%20you,%0a%0aThe%20BizSpark%20Team)

### Suggestion

If you tried to activate a new benefit subscription and you got an error during sign up, verify that your subscription setup has been completed at the [Azure subscription page](http://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions). It may take a few minutes for your subscription to show as active. When your subscription is activated, you receive an email. If your subscription status remains pending for more than four minutes, [contact Azure Support](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=544831&clcid=0x409) for help.

## Can’t activate new Azure In Open subscription

You must have a valid OSA key with at least an Azure In Open token associated to it to activate a new Azure In Open subscription.

### Suggestion

If you do not have an OSA key, contact one of Microsoft Partners listed in [Microsoft Pinpoint](http://pinpoint.microsoft.com/).

## Can’t activate Azure Free Trial

Have you used an Azure subscription in the past? The Azure Terms of Use agreement limits free trial activation only for a user that's new to Azure. If you have had any other type of Azure subscription, you can't activate a free trial.

### Suggestion

-  If you activated an Azure subscription in the past and the free trial activation fails, consider the Pay-As-You-Go subscription. 
-  Check to see if you're eligible for a benefit offer. Learn more at the [Microsoft Azure offer details page](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/offer-details/). Benefit plans require specific prerequisites.
