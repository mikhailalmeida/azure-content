# Overview of alerts in Microsoft Azure


This article describes what alerts are, their benefits, and how to get started with using them.  

## What are alerts?
Alerts are a method of monitoring Azure resource metrics, events, or logs and then being notified when a condition you specify is met.

You can receive alerts based on:

- **Metric values**: This alert triggers when the value of a specified metric crosses a threshold that you assign in either direction. That is, it triggers both when the condition is first met and then afterward when that condition is no longer being met.
- **Activity log events**: This alert can trigger on every event or only when a certain number of events occur.

## Alerts in different Azure services

Alerts are available across different services, including:

- **Application Insights**: Enables web test and metric alerts. See [Set alerts in Application Insights](../application-insights/app-insights-alerts.md) and [Monitor availability and responsiveness of any website](../application-insights/app-insights-monitor-web-app-availability.md).
- **Log Analytics (Operations Management Suite)**: Enables the routing of diagnostic logs to Log Analytics. Operations Management Suite allows metric, log, and other alert types. For more information, see [Alerts in Log Analytics](../log-analytics/log-analytics-alerts.md). Â 
- **Azure Monitor**: Enables alerts based on both metric values and activity log events. Azure Monitor includes the [Azure Monitor REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn931943.aspx).  For more information, see [Using the Azure portal, PowerShell, or the command-line interface to create alerts](insights-alerts-portal.md).

## Alert actions
You can configure an alert to do the following:

- Send email notifications to the service administrator, to co-administrators, or to additional email addresses that you specify.
- Call a webhook, which enables you to launch additional automation actions.
