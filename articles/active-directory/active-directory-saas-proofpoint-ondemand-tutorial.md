# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Proofpoint on Demand

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Proofpoint on Demand with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Proofpoint on Demand with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to Proofpoint on Demand.
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed on to Proofpoint on Demand (single sign-on, or SSO) with their Azure AD accounts.
- You can manage your accounts in one central location, the Azure classic portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory?](active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Proofpoint on Demand, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A Proofpoint on Demand single sign-on subscription


To test the steps in this tutorial, follow these recommendations:

- Don't use your production environment, unless this is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).


## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Add Proofpoint on Demand from the gallery.
2. Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on.


## Add Proofpoint on Demand from the gallery
To configure the integration of Proofpoint on Demand into Azure AD, you need to add Proofpoint on Demand from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. In the Azure classic portal, in the left navigation pane, click **Active Directory**.

	![Active Directory icon][1]
2. From the **Directory** list, select the directory for which you want to enable directory integration.

3. To open the applications view, in the directory view, click **APPLICATIONS** on the menu at the top.

	![APPLICATIONS menu item][2]

4. Click **ADD** at the bottom of the page.

	![ADD button][3]

5. In the **What do you want to do** dialog box, click **Add an application from the gallery**.

	![Choice of adding an application from the gallery][4]

6. In the search box, type **Proofpoint on Demand**.

	![Box where you type "Proofpoint on Demand"](./media/active-directory-saas-proofpoint-ondemand-tutorial/tutorial_proofpointondemand_01.png)

7. In the results pane, select **Proofpoint on Demand**, and then click **Complete** to add the application.



##  Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on
In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Proofpoint on Demand based on a test user named Britta Simon.

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in Proofpoint on Demand is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Proofpoint on Demand.

You establish this link relationship by assigning the value of **user name** in Azure AD as the value of **Username** in Proofpoint on Demand.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Proofpoint on Demand, complete the following procedures:

1. [Configure Azure AD single sign-on](#configuring-azure-ad-single-sign-on), to enable your users to use this feature.
2. [Create an Azure AD test user](#creating-an-azure-ad-test-user), to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. [Create a Proofpoint on Demand test user](#creating-a-proofpoint-ondemand-test-user), to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Proofpoint on Demand that is linked to the Azure AD representation of her.
4. [Assign the Azure AD test user](#assigning-the-azure-ad-test-user), to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. [Test single sign-on](#testing-single-sign-on), to verify that the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the classic portal and configure single sign-on in your Proofpoint on Demand application.

1. In the classic portal, on the **Proofpoint on Demand** application integration page, click **Configure single sign-on** to open the **Configure Single Sign-On** dialog box.
