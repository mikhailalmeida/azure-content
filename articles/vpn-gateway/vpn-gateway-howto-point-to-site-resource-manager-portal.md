# Configure a Point-to-Site connection to a VNet using the Azure Portal

> [AZURE.SELECTOR]
- [Resource Manager - Azure Portal](vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal.md)
- [Resource Manager - PowerShell](vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-rm-ps.md)
- [Classic - Azure Portal](vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-classic-azure-portal.md)

A Point-to-Site (P2S) configuration lets you create a secure connection from an individual client computer to a virtual network. A P2S connection is useful when you want to connect to your VNet from a remote location, such as from home or a conference, or when you only have a few clients that need to connect to a virtual network. 

Point-to-Site connections do not require a VPN device or a public-facing IP address to work. A VPN connection is established by starting the connection from the client computer. For more information about Point-to-Site connections, see the [VPN Gateway FAQ](vpn-gateway-vpn-faq.md#point-to-site-connections) and [Planning and Design](vpn-gateway-plan-design.md).

This article walks you through creating a VNet with a Point-to-Site connection in the Resource Manager deployment model using the Azure portal.

### Deployment models and methods for P2S connections

[AZURE.INCLUDE [deployment models](../../includes/vpn-gateway-deployment-models-include.md)] 

The following table shows the two deployment models and available deployment methods for P2S configurations. When an article with configuration steps is available, we link directly to it from this table.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [vpn-gateway-clasic-rm](../../includes/vpn-gateway-table-point-to-site-include.md)] 

## Basic workflow 

![Point-to-Site-diagram](./media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-rm-ps/p2srm.png "point-to-site")

### <a name="example"></a>Example values

- **Name: VNet1**
- **Address space: 192.168.0.0/16**<br>For this example, we use only one address space. You can have more than one address space for your VNet.
- **Subnet name: FrontEnd**
- **Subnet address range: 192.168.1.0/24**
- **Subscription:** If you have more than one subscription, verify that you are using the correct one.
- **Resource Group: TestRG**
- **Location: East US**
- **GatewaySubnet: 192.168.200.0/24**
- **Virtual network gateway name: VNet1GW**
- **Gateway type: VPN**
- **VPN type: Route-based**
- **Public IP address: VNet1GWpip**
- **Connection type: Point-to-site**
- **Client address pool: 172.16.201.0/24**<br>VPN clients that connect to the VNet using this Point-to-Site connection receive an IP address from the client address pool.

## Before beginning

- Verify that you have an Azure subscription. If you don't already have an Azure subscription, you can activate your [MSDN subscriber benefits](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/) or sign up for a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).
	
## <a name="createvnet"></a>Part 1 - Create a virtual network

If you are creating this configuration as an exercise, you can refer to the [example values](#example).

[AZURE.INCLUDE [vpn-gateway-basic-vnet-rm-portal](../../includes/vpn-gateway-basic-vnet-rm-portal-include.md)]  

### 2. Add additional address space and subnets

You can add additional address space and subnets to your VNet once it has been created.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [vpn-gateway-additional-address-space](../../includes/vpn-gateway-additional-address-space-include.md)] 

### 3. Create a gateway subnet

Before connecting your virtual network to a gateway, you first need to create the gateway subnet for the virtual network to which you want to connect. If possible, it's best to create a gateway subnet using a CIDR block of /28 or /27 in order to provide enough IP addresses to accommodate additional future configuration requirements.

The screenshots in this section are provided as a reference example. Be sure to use the GatewaySubnet address range that corresponds with the required values for your configuration.

#### To create a gateway subnet

[AZURE.INCLUDE [vpn-gateway-add-gwsubnet-rm-portal](../../includes/vpn-gateway-add-gwsubnet-rm-portal-include.md)]

### <a name="dns"></a>4. Specify a DNS server (optional)

[AZURE.INCLUDE [vpn-gateway-add-dns-rm-portal](../../includes/vpn-gateway-add-dns-rm-portal-include.md)]

## <a name="creategw"></a>Part 2 - Create a virtual network gateway

Point-to-site connections require the following settings:

- Gateway type: VPN
- VPN type: Route-based

## <a name="generatecert"></a>Part 3 - Generate certificates

Certificates are used by Azure to authenticate VPN clients for Point-to-Site VPNs. You export public certificate data (not the private key) as a Base-64 encoded X.509 .cer file from either a root certificate generated by an enterprise certificate solution, or a self-signed root certificate. You then import the public certificate data from the root certificate to Azure. Additionally, you need to generate a client certificate from the root certificate for clients. Each client that wants to connect to the virtual network using a P2S connection must have a client certificate installed that was generated from the root certificate.

### <a name="getcer"></a>1. Obtain the .cer file for the root certificate

If you are using an enterprise solution, you can use your existing certificate chain. If you aren't using an enterprise CA solution, you can create a self-signed root cert. One method for creating a self-signed cert is makecert.

- If you are using an enterprise certificate system, obtain the .cer file for the root certificate that you want to use. 

- If you are not using an enterprise certificate solution, you need to generate a self-signed root certificate. For Windows 10 steps, you can refer to [Working with self-signed root certificates for Point-to-Site configurations](vpn-gateway-certificates-point-to-site.md).

1. To obtain a .cer file from a certificate, open **certmgr.msc** and locate the root certificate. Right-click the self-signed root certificate, click **all tasks**, and then click **export**. This opens the **Certificate Export Wizard**.

2. In the Wizard, click **Next**, select **No, do not export the private key**, and then click **Next**.

3. On the **Export File Format** page, select **Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER).** Then, click **Next**. 

4. On the **File to Export**, **Browse** to the location to which you want to export the certificate. For **File name**, name the certificate file. Then click **Next**.

5. Click **Finish** to export the certificate.

### <a name="generateclientcert"></a>2. Generate a client certificate

You can either generate a unique certificate for each client that will connect, or you can use the same certificate on multiple clients. The advantage to generating unique client certificates is the ability to revoke a single certificate if needed. Otherwise, if everyone is using the same client certificate and you find that you need to revoke the certificate for one client, you will need to generate and install new certificates for all of the clients that use that certificate to authenticate.

- If you are using an enterprise certificate solution, generate a client certificate with the common name value format 'name@yourdomain.com', rather than the 'domain name\username' format. 

- If you are using a self-signed certificate, see [Working with self-signed root certificates for Point-to-Site configurations](vpn-gateway-certificates-point-to-site.md) to generate a client certificate.

### <a name="exportclientcert"></a>3. Export the client certificate

A client certificate is required for authentication. After generating the client certificate, export it. The client certificate you export will be installed later on each client computer.

1. To export a client certificate, you can use *certmgr.msc*. Right-click the client certificate that you want to export, click **all tasks**, and then click **export**.
2. Export the client certificate with the private key. This is a *.pfx* file. Make sure to record or remember the password (key) that you set for this certificate.

## <a name="addresspool"></a>Part 4 - Add the client address pool

1. Once the virtual network gateway has been created, navigate to the **Settings** section of the virtual network gateway blade. In the **Settings** section, click **Point-to-site configuration** to open the **Configuration** blade.

	![point to site blade](./media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal/configuration.png "point to site blade")

2. **Address pool** is the pool of IP addresses from which clients that connect will receive an IP address. Add the address pool, and then click **Save**.

	![client address pool](./media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal/addresspool.png "client address pool")

## <a name="uploadfile"></a>Part 5 - Upload the root certificate .cer file

After the gateway has been created, you can upload the .cer file for a trusted root certificate to Azure. You can upload files for up to 20 root certificates. You do not upload the private key for the root certificate to Azure. Once the .cer file is uploaded, Azure uses it to authenticate clients that connect to the virtual network.

1. Navigate to the **Point-to-site configuration** blade. You will add the .cer files in the **Root certificate** section of this blade.

	![point to site blade](./media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal/rootcert.png "point to site blade")

2. Make sure that you exported the root certificate as a Base-64 encoded X.509 (.cer) file. You need to export it in this format so that you can open the certificate with text editor.
3. Open the certificate with a text editor, such as Notepad. Copy only the following section:

	![certificate data](./media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal/copycert.png "certificate data")

4. Paste the certificate data into the **Public Certificate Data** section of the portal. Put the name of the certificate in the **Name** space, and then click **Save**. You can add up to 20 trusted root certificates.

	![certificate upload](./media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal/uploadcert.png "certificate upload")

## <a name="clientconfig"></a>Part 6 - Download and install the VPN client configuration package

Clients connecting to Azure using P2S must have both a client certificate, and a VPN client configuration package installed. VPN client configuration packages are available for Windows clients. 

The VPN client package contains information to configure the VPN client software that is built into Windows. The configuration is specific to the VPN that you want to connect to. The package does not install additional software. See the [VPN Gateway FAQ](vpn-gateway-vpn-faq.md#point-to-site-connections) for more information.

1. On the **Point-to-site configuration** blade, click **Download VPN client** to open the **Download VPN client** blade.

	![VPN client download](./media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal/downloadclient.png "VPN client download")

2. Select the correct package for your client, then click **Download**. For 64-bit clients, select **AMD64**. For 32-bit clients, select **x86**.

3. Install the package on the client computer. If you get a SmartScreen popup, click **More info**, then **Run anyway** in order to install the package.

4. On the client computer, navigate to **Network Settings** and click **VPN**. You will see the connection listed. It will show the name of the virtual network that it will connect to and looks similar to this example: 

	![VPN client](./media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal/vpn.png "VPN client")

## <a name="installclientcert"></a>Part 7 - Install the client certificate

Each client computer must have a client certificate in order to authenticate. When installing the client certificate, you will need the password that was created when the client certificate was exported.

1. Copy the .pfx file to the client computer.
2. Double-click the .pfx file to install it. Do not modify the installation location.

## <a name="connect"></a>Part 8 - Connect to Azure

1. To connect to your VNet, on the client computer, navigate to VPN connections and locate the VPN connection that you created. It is named the same name as your virtual network. Click **Connect**. A pop-up message may appear that refers to using the certificate. If this happens, click **Continue** to use elevated privileges. 

2. On the **Connection** status page, click **Connect** to start the connection. If you see a **Select Certificate** screen, verify that the client certificate showing is the one that you want to use to connect. If it is not, use the drop-down arrow to select the correct certificate, and then click **OK**.

	![VPN client 2](./media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-rm-ps/clientconnect.png "VPN client connection")

3. Your connection should now be established.

	![VPN client 3](./media/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-rm-ps/connected.png "VPN client connection 2")

## <a name="verify"></a>Part 9 - Verify your connection

1. To verify that your VPN connection is active, open an elevated command prompt, and run *ipconfig/all*.

2. View the results. Notice that the IP address you received is one of the addresses within the Point-to-Site VPN Client Address Pool that you specified in your configuration. The results should be something similar to this:
    
		PPP adapter VNet1:
			Connection-specific DNS Suffix .:
			Description.....................: VNet1
			Physical Address................:
			DHCP Enabled....................: No
			Autoconfiguration Enabled.......: Yes
			IPv4 Address....................: 172.16.201.3(Preferred)
			Subnet Mask.....................: 255.255.255.255
			Default Gateway.................:
			NetBIOS over Tcpip..............: Enabled

## <a name="add"></a>To add or remove trusted root certificates

You can remove trusted root certificate from Azure. When you remove a trusted certificate, the client certificates that were generated from the root certificate will no longer be able to connect to Azure via Point-to-Site. If you want clients to connect, they need to install a new client certificate that is generated from a certificate that is trusted in Azure.

You can manage the list of revoked client certificates on the **Point-to-site configuration** blade. This is the blade that you used to [upload a trusted root certificate](#uploadfile).

## <a name="revokeclient"></a>To manage the list of revoked client certificates

You can revoke client certificates. The certificate revocation list allows you to selectively deny Point-to-Site connectivity based on individual client certificates. If you remove a root certificate .cer from Azure, it revokes the access for all client certificates generated/signed by the revoked root certificate. If you want to revoke a particular client certificate, not the root, you can do so. That way the other certificates that were generated from the root certificate will still be valid. 

The common practice is to use the root certificate to manage access at team or organization levels, while using revoked client certificates for fine-grained access control on individual users.

You can manage the list of revoked client certificates on the **Point-to-site configuration** blade. This is the blade that you used to [upload a trusted root certificate](#uploadfile).
