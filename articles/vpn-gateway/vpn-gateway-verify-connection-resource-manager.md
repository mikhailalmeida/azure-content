# Verify a gateway connection

You can verify your gateway connection in a few different ways. This article will show you how to verify the status of a Resource Manager gateway connection by using the Azure portal and by using PowerShell.


## Verify using PowerShell

You'll need to install the latest version of the Azure Resource Manager PowerShell cmdlets. For information on installing PowerShell cmdlets, see [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](../powershell-install-configure.md). For more information about using Resource Manager cmdlets, see [Using Windows PowerShell with Resource Manager](../powershell-azure-resource-manager.md).

### Step 1: Log in to your Azure account

1. Open your PowerShell console with elevated privileges and connect to your account.

		Login-AzureRmAccount

2. Check the subscriptions for the account.

		Get-AzureRmSubscription 

3. Specify the subscription that you want to use.

		Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionName "Replace_with_your_subscription_name"

### Step 2: Verify your connection
