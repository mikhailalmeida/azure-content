# Introduction to App Service on Linux
Azure App Service on Linux is currently in public preview and supports running web apps natively on Linux.

## Overview ##
Customers can use App Service on Linux to host web apps natively on Linux for supported application stacks. The following section lists the application stacks that are currently supported.

## Features ##
App Service on Linux currently supports the following application stacks:

- Node.js
- PHP

Customers can deploy their applications by using:

- FTP
- Local Git
- GitHub or Bitbucket

For application scaling:


- Customers can scale their web apps up and down by changing the tier in their App Service plan.
- Customers can scale out their applications out and run their app across multiple instances within the confines of their SKU.

For Kudu, some of the basic functionality works with the following:

- Environments
- Deployments
- Basic consoles

## Limitations ##

The Azure portal shows only features that currently work for App Service on Linux and hides the rest. As we enable more features, you will see them reflected on the portal.

Some features, such as virtual network integration, Azure Active Directory/third-party authentication, or Kudu site extensions, don't currently work. But as we get these working, we will update our documentation and blog about the changes.

This public preview is currently only available in the following regions:

-	West US
-	West Europe 
-	Southeast Asia

Web Apps on Linux is only supported in the Dedicated app service plans and does not have a Free or Shared tier. Also, App Service plans for regular and Linux web apps are mutually exclusive, so you cannot create a Linux web app in a non-Linux app service plan.

Web Apps on Linux must be created in a resource group that does not contain non-Linux web apps in the same region.

Due to the lack of overlapped recycling of the web apps, customers should expect a small downtime if a web app gets restarted.
