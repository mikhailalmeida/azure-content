# Create and manage a cluster running on Windows Server

You can use Azure Service Fabric to create Service Fabric clusters on any virtual machines or computers running Windows Server. This means you can deploy and run Service Fabric applications in any environment that contains a set of interconnected Windows Server computers, be it on premises or with any cloud provider. Service Fabric provides a setup package to create Service Fabric clusters called the standalone Windows Server package.

This article walks you through the steps for creating a cluster by using the standalone package for Service Fabric on premises, though it can be easily adapted for any other environment such as other cloud providers.

>[AZURE.NOTE] This standalone Windows Server package may contain features that are currently in preview and are not supported for commercial use. To see the list of features that are in preview, see "Preview features included in this package." You can also [download a copy of the EULA](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=733084) now.

## Plan and prepare your cluster deployment
Perform the following steps before you create your cluster.

### Step 1: Plan your cluster infrastructure
You are about to create a Service Fabric cluster on machines you own, so you can decide what kinds of failures you want the cluster to survive. For example, do you need separate power lines or Internet connections supplied to these machines? In addition, consider the physical security of these machines. Where are the machines located and who needs access to them? After you make these decisions, you can logically map the machines to the various fault domains (see Step 4). The infrastructure planning for production clusters is more involved than for test clusters.

<a id="preparemachines"></a>
### Step 2: Prepare the machines to meet the prerequisites
Prerequisites for each machine that you want to add to the cluster:

- A minimum of 16 GB of RAM is recommended.
- A minimum of 40 of GB available disk space is recommended.
- A 4 core or greater CPU is recommended.
- Connectivity to a secure network or networks for all machines.
- Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2012 (you need to have [KB2858668](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2858668) installed).
- [.NET Framework 4.5.1 or higher](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=40773), full install.
- [Windows PowerShell 3.0](https://msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/setup/installing-windows-powershell).
- The [RemoteRegistry service](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc754820) should be running on all the machines.

The cluster administrator deploying and configuring the cluster must have [administrator privileges](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/13436.windows-server-2012-how-to-add-an-account-to-a-local-administrator-group.aspx) on each of the machines. You cannot install Service Fabric on a domain controller.

### Step 3: Determine the initial cluster size
Each node in a standalone Service Fabric cluster has the Service Fabric runtime deployed and is a member of the cluster. In a typical production deployment, there is one node per OS instance (physical or virtual). The cluster size is determined by your business needs. However, you must have a minimum cluster size of three nodes (machines or virtual machines).
For development purposes, you can have more than one node on a given machine. In a production environment, Service Fabric supports only one node per physical or virtual machine.

### Step 4: Determine the number of fault domains and upgrade domains
A *fault domain* (FD) is a physical unit of failure and is directly related to the physical infrastructure in the data centers. A fault domain consists of hardware components (computers, switches, networks, and more) that share a single point of failure. Although there is no 1:1 mapping between fault domains and racks, loosely speaking, each rack can be considered a fault domain. When considering the nodes in your cluster, we strongly recommend that the nodes be distributed among at least three fault domains.

When you specify FDs in ClusterConfig.json, you can choose the name for each FD. Service Fabric supports hierarchical FDs, so you can reflect your infrastructure topology in them.  For example, the following FDs are valid:

- "faultDomain": "fd:/Room1/Rack1/Machine1"
- "faultDomain": "fd:/FD1"
- "faultDomain": "fd:/Room1/Rack1/PDU1/M1"


An *upgrade domain* (UD) is a logical unit of nodes. During Service Fabric orchestrated upgrades (either an application upgrade or a cluster upgrade), all nodes in a UD are taken down to perform the upgrade while nodes in other UDs remain available to serve requests. The firmware upgrades you perform on your machines do not honor UDs, so you must do them one machine at a time.

The simplest way to think about these concepts is to consider FDs as the unit of unplanned failure and UDs as the unit of planned maintenance.

When you specify UDs in ClusterConfig.json, you can choose the name for each UD. For example, the following names are valid:

- "upgradeDomain": "UD0"
- "upgradeDomain": "UD1A"
- "upgradeDomain": "DomainRed"
- "upgradeDomain": "Blue"

For more detailed information on upgrade domains and fault domains, see [Describing a Service Fabric cluster](service-fabric-cluster-resource-manager-cluster-description.md).

### Step 5: Download the Service Fabric standalone package for Windows Server
[Download the Service Fabric standalone package for Windows Server](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=730690) and unzip the package, either to a deployment machine that is not part of the cluster, or to one of the machines that will be a part of your cluster. You may rename the unzipped folder `Microsoft.Azure.ServiceFabric.WindowsServer`.

<a id="createcluster"></a>
## Create your cluster

After you have gone through the planning and preparation steps, you are ready to create your cluster.

### Step 1: Modify cluster configuration
The cluster is described in ClusterConfig.json. For details on the sections in this file, see [Configuration settings for standalone Windows cluster](service-fabric-cluster-manifest.md).
Open one of the ClusterConfig.json files from the package you downloaded and modify the following settings:

<!--Loc Comment: Please, check that line 129 the clause has been modified to "that you use as placement constraints" instead of using "you are used as placement constraints"-->

|**Configuration Setting**|**Description**|
|-----------------------|--------------------------|
|**NodeTypes**|Node types allow you to separate your cluster nodes into various groups. A cluster must have at least one NodeType. All nodes in a group have the following common characteristics: <br> **Name** - This is the node type name. <br>**Endpoint Ports** - These are various named end points (ports) that are associated with this node type. You can use any port number that you wish, as long as they do not conflict with anything else in this manifest and are not already in use by any other application running on the machine/VM. <br> **Placement Properties** - These describe properties for this node type that you use as placement constraints for the system services or your services. These properties are user-defined key/value pairs that provide extra meta data for a given node. Examples of node properties would be whether the node has a hard drive or graphics card, the number of spindles in its hard drive, cores, and other physical properties. <br> **Capacities** - Node capacities define the name and amount of a particular resource that a particular node has available for consumption. For example, a node may define that it has capacity for a metric called “MemoryInMb” and that it has 2048 MB available by default. These capacities are used at runtime to ensure that services that require particular amounts of resources are placed on the nodes that have those resources available in the required amounts.<br>**IsPrimary** - If you have more than one NodeType defined ensure that only one is set to primary with the value *true*, which is where the system services run. All other node types should be set to the value *false*|
|**Nodes**|These are the details for each of the nodes that are part of the cluster (node type, node name, IP address, fault domain, and upgrade domain of the node). The machines you want the cluster to be created on need to be listed here with their IP addresses. <br> If you use the same IP address for all the nodes, then a one-box cluster is created, which you can use for testing purposes. Do not use One-box clusters for deploying production workloads.|


### Step 2: Run the TestConfiguration script

The TestConfiguration script tests your infrastructure as defined in cluster.json to make sure that the needed permissions are assigned, the machines are connected to each other, and other attributes are defined so that the deployment can succeed. It is basically a mini Best Practices Analyzer. We will continue to add more validations to this tool over time to make it more robust.

This script can be run on any machine that has administrator access to all the machines that are listed as nodes in the cluster configuration file. The machine that this script is run on does not have to be part of the cluster.

```powershell

PS C:\temp\Microsoft.Azure.ServiceFabric.WindowsServer> .\TestConfiguration.ps1 -ClusterConfigFilePath .\ClusterConfig.Unsecure.DevCluster.json
Trace folder already exists. Traces will be written to existing trace folder: C:\temp\Microsoft.Azure.ServiceFabric.WindowsServer\DeploymentTraces
Running Best Practices Analyzer...
Best Practices Analyzer completed successfully.


LocalAdminPrivilege        : True
IsJsonValid                : True
IsCabValid                 : True
RequiredPortsOpen          : True
RemoteRegistryAvailable    : True
FirewallAvailable          : True
RpcCheckPassed             : True
NoConflictingInstallations : True
FabricInstallable          : True
Passed                     : True


```

### Step 3: Run the create cluster script
After you have modified the cluster configuration in the JSON doc and added all the node information to it, run the cluster creation *CreateServiceFabricCluster.ps1* PowerShell script from the package folder and pass in the path to the JSON configuration file. When this is complete, accept the EULA.

This script can be run on any machine that has administrator access to all the machines that are listed as nodes in the cluster configuration file. The machine that this script is run on does not have to be part of the cluster.

```
#Create an unsecured local development cluster

.\CreateServiceFabricCluster.ps1 -ClusterConfigFilePath .\ClusterConfig.Unsecure.DevCluster.json -AcceptEULA
```
```
#Create an unsecured multi-machine cluster

.\CreateServiceFabricCluster.ps1 -ClusterConfigFilePath .\ClusterConfig.Unsecure.MultiMachine.json -AcceptEULA
```

>[AZURE.NOTE] The deployment logs are available locally on the VM/machine that you ran the CreateServiceFabricCluster PowerShell on. They are in a subfolder called DeploymentTraces under the folder where you ran the PowerShell command. To see if Service Fabric was deployed correctly to a machine, you can find the installed files in the C:\ProgramData directory, and the FabricHost.exe and Fabric.exe processes can be seen running in Task Manager.

### Step 4: Connect to the cluster

To connect to a secure cluster, see [Service fabric connect to secure cluster](service-fabric-connect-to-secure-cluster.md).

To connect to an unsecure cluster, run the following PowerShell command:

```powershell

Connect-ServiceFabricCluster -ConnectionEndpoint <*IPAddressofaMachine*>:<Client connection end point port>

Connect-ServiceFabricCluster -ConnectionEndpoint 192.13.123.2345:19000

```
### Step 5: Bring up Service Fabric Explorer

Now you can connect to the cluster with Service Fabric Explorer either directly from one of the machines with http://localhost:19080/Explorer/index.html or remotely with http://<*IPAddressofaMachine*>:19080/Explorer/index.html.



## Add and remove nodes

You can add or remove nodes to your standalone Service Fabric cluster as your business needs change. See [Add or Remove nodes to a Service Fabric standalone cluster](service-fabric-cluster-windows-server-add-remove-nodes.md) for detailed steps.


## Remove a cluster

To remove a cluster, run the *RemoveServiceFabricCluster.ps1* PowerShell script from the package folder and pass in the path to the JSON configuration file. You can optionally specify a location for the log of the deletion.

This script can be run on any machine that has administrator access to all the machines that are listed as nodes in the cluster configuration file. The machine that this script is run on does not have to be part of the cluster.

```
.\RemoveServiceFabricCluster.ps1 -ClusterConfigFilePath .\ClusterConfig.Unsecure.MultiMachine.json   
```


<a id="telemetry"></a>
## Telemetry data collected and how to opt out of it

As a default, the product collects telemetry on the Service Fabric usage to improve the product. The Best Practice Analyzer that runs as a part of the setup checks for connectivity to [https://vortex.data.microsoft.com/collect/v1](https://vortex.data.microsoft.com/collect/v1). If it is not reachable, the setup fails unless you opt out of telemetry.

  1. The telemetry pipeline tries to upload the following data to [https://vortex.data.microsoft.com/collect/v1](https://vortex.data.microsoft.com/collect/v1) once every day. It is a best-effort upload and has no impact on the cluster functionality. The telemetry is only sent from the node that runs the failover manager primary. No other nodes send out telemetry.

  2. The telemetry consists of the following:

-            Number of services
-            Number of ServiceTypes
-            Number of Applications
-            Number of ApplicationUpgrades
-            Number of FailoverUnits
-            Number of InBuildFailoverUnits
-            Number of UnhealthyFailoverUnits
-            Number of Replicas
-            Number of InBuildReplicas
-            Number of StandByReplicas
-            Number of OfflineReplicas
-            CommonQueueLength
-            QueryQueueLength
-            FailoverUnitQueueLength
-            CommitQueueLength
-            Number of Nodes
-            IsContextComplete: True/False
-            ClusterId: This is a GUID randomly generated for each cluster
-            ServiceFabricVersion
-             IP address of the virtual machine or machine from which the telemetry is uploaded


To disable telemetry, add the following to *properties* in your cluster config: *enableTelemetry: false*.

<a id="previewfeatures"></a>
## Preview features included in this package
