# Preview: Deploy a Windows container to Service Fabric

> [AZURE.SELECTOR]
- [Deploy Windows Container](service-fabric-deploy-container.md)
- [Deploy Docker Container](service-fabric-deploy-container-linux.md)

This article walks you through the process of building containerized services in Windows containers.

>[AZURE.NOTE] This feature is in preview for Linux and is not currently available for use with Windows Server 2016. It will be available in preview for Windows Server 2016 in the next release of Azure Service Fabric and supported in the subsequent release.

Service Fabric has several container capabilities that help you with building applications that are composed of microservices that are containerized. These are called containerized services.

The capabilities include:

- Container image deployment and activation
- Resource governance
- Repository authentication
- Container port-to-host port mapping
- Container-to-container discovery and communication
- Ability to configure and set environment variables

Let's look at how each of capabilities works when you're packaging a containerized service to be included in your application.

## Package a Windows container

When you package a container, you can choose to use either a Visual Studio project template or [create the application package manually](#manually). When you use Visual Studio, the application package structure and manifest files are created by the New Project Template for you. (This is coming in a future release.)

## Use Visual Studio to package an existing container image

>[AZURE.NOTE] In a future release of Visual Studio tooling for Service Fabric, you will be able to add a container to an application in the way that you can add a guest executable today. For more information, see [Deploy a guest executable to Service Fabric](service-fabric-deploy-existing-app.md) topic. Currently you have to manually package a container as described in the following section.

<a id="manually"></a>
## Manually package and deploy a container
The process of manually packaging a containerized service is based on the following steps:

1. Published the containers to your repository.
2. Create the package directory structure.
3. Edit the service manifest file.
4. Edit the application manifest file.

## Deploy and activate a container image
In the Service Fabric [application model](service-fabric-application-model.md), a container represents an application host in which multiple service replicas are placed. To deploy and activate a container, put the name of the container image into a `ContainerHost` element in the service manifest.

In the service manifest, add a `ContainerHost` for the entry point. Then set the `ImageName` to be the name of the container repository and image. The following partial manifest shows an example of how to deploy the container called *myimage:v1* from a repository called *myrepo*:

    <CodePackage Name="Code" Version="1.0">
        <EntryPoint>
          <ContainerHost>
            <ImageName>myrepo/myimage:v1</ImageName>
            <Commands></Commands>
          </ContainerHost>
        </EntryPoint>
    </CodePackage>

You can provide input commands to the container image by specifying the optional `Commands` element with a comma-delimited set of commands to run inside the container.

## Understand resource governance
Resource governance is a capability of the container that restricts the resources that the container can use on the host. The `ResourceGovernancePolicy`, which is specified in the application manifest, provides the ability to declare resource limits for a service code package. Resource limits can be set for:

- Memory
- MemorySwap
- CpuShares (CPU relative weight)
- MemoryReservationInMB  
- BlkioWeight (BlockIO relative weight).

>[AZURE.NOTE] In a future release, support for specifying specific block IO limits such as IOPs, read/write BPS, and others will be possible.


    <ServiceManifestImport>
        <ServiceManifestRef ServiceManifestName="FrontendServicePackage" ServiceManifestVersion="1.0"/>
        <Policies>
            <ResourceGovernancePolicy CodePackageRef="FrontendService.Code" CpuShares="500"
            MemoryInMB="1024" MemorySwapInMB="4084" MemoryReservationInMB="1024" />
        </Policies>
    </ServiceManifestImport>


## Authenticate a repository
To download a container, you might have to provide sign-in credentials to the container repository. The sign-in credentials, specified in the application manifest, are used to specify the sign-in information, or SSH key, for downloading the container image from the image repository. The following example shows an account called *TestUser* along with the password in clear text. This is *not* recommended.


    <ServiceManifestImport>
        <ServiceManifestRef ServiceManifestName="FrontendServicePackage" ServiceManifestVersion="1.0"/>
        <Policies>
            <ContainerHostPolicies CodePackageRef="FrontendService.Code">
                <RepositoryCredentials AccountName="TestUser" Password="12345" PasswordEncrypted="false"/>
            </ContainerHostPolicies>
        </Policies>
    </ServiceManifestImport>

We recommend that you encrypt the password by using a certificate that's deployed to the machine.

The following example shows an account called *TestUser*, where the password was encrypted by using a certificate called *MyCert*. You can use the `Invoke-ServiceFabricEncryptText` PowerShell command to create the secret cipher text for the password. For more information, see the article [Managing secrets in Service Fabric applications](service-fabric-application-secret-management.md).

The private key of the certificate that's used to decrypt the password must be deployed to the local machine in an out-of-band method. (In Azure, this method is Azure Resource Manager.) Then, when Service Fabric deploys the service package to the machine, it can decrypt the secret. By using the secret along with the account name, it can then authenticate with the container repository.


    <ServiceManifestImport>
        <ServiceManifestRef ServiceManifestName="FrontendServicePackage" ServiceManifestVersion="1.0"/>
        <Policies>
            <ContainerHostPolicies CodePackageRef="FrontendService.Code">
                <RepositoryCredentials AccountName="TestUser" Password="[Put encrypted password here using MyCert certificate ]" PasswordEncrypted="true"/>
            </ContainerHostPolicies>
        </Policies>
    </ServiceManifestImport>

## Configure container port-to-host port mapping
You can configure a host port used to communicate with the container by specifying a `PortBinding` in the application manifest. The port binding maps the port to which the service is listening inside the container to a port on the host.


    <ServiceManifestImport>
        <ServiceManifestRef ServiceManifestName="FrontendServicePackage" ServiceManifestVersion="1.0"/>
        <Policies>
            <ContainerHostPolicies CodePackageRef="FrontendService.Code">
                <PortBinding ContainerPort="8905"/>
            </ContainerHostPolicies>
        </Policies>
    </ServiceManifestImport>


## Configure container-to-container discovery and communication
By using the `PortBinding` policy, you can map a container port to an `Endpoint` in the service manifest as shown in the following example. The endpoint `Endpoint1` can specify a fixed port (for example, port 80). It can also specify no port at all, in which case a random port from the cluster's application port range is chosen for you.

If you specify an `Endpoint` like this in the service manifest of a guest container, Service Fabric can automatically publish this endpoint to the Naming service. This means that other services that are running in the cluster can discover this container by using the resolve service REST queries.

    <ServiceManifestImport>
        <ServiceManifestRef ServiceManifestName="FrontendServicePackage" ServiceManifestVersion="1.0"/>
        <Policies>
            <ContainerHostPolicies CodePackageRef="FrontendService.Code">
                <PortBinding ContainerPort="8905" EndpointRef="Endpoint1"/>
            </ContainerHostPolicies>
        </Policies>
    </ServiceManifestImport>

By registering with the Naming service, you can easily do container-to-container communication in the code within your container by using the [reverse proxy](service-fabric-reverseproxy.md). All you need to do is provide the reverse proxy http listening port and the name of the services that you want to communicate with by setting these as environment variables. See the next section for more information about how to do this.  

## Configure and set environment variables
Environment variables can be specified for each code package in the service manifest, both for services that are deployed in containers or for services that are deployed as processes/guest executables. These environment variable values can be overridden specifically in the application manifest or specified during deployment as application parameters.

The following service manifest XML snippet shows an example of how to specify environment variables for a code package:

    <ServiceManifest Name="FrontendServicePackage" Version="1.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2011/01/fabric" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
        <Description>a guest executable service in a container</Description>
        <ServiceTypes>
            <StatelessServiceType ServiceTypeName="StatelessFrontendService"  UseImplicitHost="true"/>
        </ServiceTypes>
        <CodePackage Name="FrontendService.Code" Version="1.0">
            <EntryPoint>
            <ContainerHost>
                <ImageName>myrepo/myimage:v1</ImageName>
                <Commands></Commands>
            </ContainerHost>
            </EntryPoint>
            <EnvironmentVariables>
                <EnvironmentVariable Name="HttpGatewayPort" Value=""/>
                <EnvironmentVariable Name="BackendServiceName" Value=""/>
            </EnvironmentVariables>
        </CodePackage>
    </ServiceManifest>

These environment variables can be overridden at the application manifest level:

    <ServiceManifestImport>
        <ServiceManifestRef ServiceManifestName="FrontendServicePackage" ServiceManifestVersion="1.0"/>
        <EnvironmentOverrides CodePackageRef="FrontendService.Code">
            <EnvironmentVariable Name="BackendServiceName" Value="[BackendSvc]"/>
            <EnvironmentVariable Name="HttpGatewayPort" Value="19080"/>
        </EnvironmentOverrides>
    </ServiceManifestImport>

In the previous example, we specified an explicit value for the `HttpGateway` environment variable (19000), while we set the value for `BackendServiceName` parameter via the `[BackendSvc]` application parameter. This enables you to specify the value for `BackendServiceName`value when you deploy the application and not have a fixed value in the manifest.

## Complete examples for application and service manifest
The following is an example application manifest that shows the container features:


    <ApplicationManifest ApplicationTypeName="SimpleContainerApp" ApplicationTypeVersion="1.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2011/01/fabric" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
        <Description>A simple service container application</Description>
        <Parameters>
            <Parameter Name="ServiceInstanceCount" DefaultValue="3"></Parameter>
            <Parameter Name="BackEndSvcName" DefaultValue="bkend"></Parameter>
        </Parameters>
        <ServiceManifestImport>
            <ServiceManifestRef ServiceManifestName="FrontendServicePackage" ServiceManifestVersion="1.0"/>
            <EnvironmentOverrides CodePackageRef="FrontendService.Code">
                <EnvironmentVariable Name="BackendServiceName" Value="[BackendSvcName]"/>
                <EnvironmentVariable Name="HttpGatewayPort" Value="19080"/>
            </EnvironmentOverrides>
            <Policies>
                <ResourceGovernancePolicy CodePackageRef="Code" CpuShares="500" MemoryInMB="1024" MemorySwapInMB="4084" MemoryReservationInMB="1024" />
                <ContainerHostPolicies CodePackageRef="FrontendService.Code">
                    <RepositoryCredentials AccountName="username" Password="****" PasswordEncrypted="true"/>
                    <PortBinding ContainerPort="8905" EndpointRef="Endpoint1"/>
                </ContainerHostPolicies>
            </Policies>
        </ServiceManifestImport>
    </ApplicationManifest>


The following is an example service manifest (specified in the preceding application manifest) that shows the container features:

    <ServiceManifest Name="FrontendServicePackage" Version="1.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2011/01/fabric" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
        <Description> A service that implements a stateless front end in a container</Description>
        <ServiceTypes>
            <StatelessServiceType ServiceTypeName="StatelessFrontendService"  UseImplicitHost="true"/>
        </ServiceTypes>
        <CodePackage Name="FrontendService.Code" Version="1.0">
            <EntryPoint>
            <ContainerHost>
                <ImageName>myrepo/myimage:v1</ImageName>
                <Commands></Commands>
            </ContainerHost>
            </EntryPoint>
            <EnvironmentVariables>
                <EnvironmentVariable Name="HttpGatewayPort" Value=""/>
                <EnvironmentVariable Name="BackendServiceName" Value=""/>
            </EnvironmentVariables>
        </CodePackage>
        <ConfigPackage Name="FrontendService.Config" Version="1.0" />
        <DataPackage Name="FrontendService.Data" Version="1.0" />
        <Resources>
            <Eendpoints>
                <Endpoint Name="Endpoint1" Port="80"  UriScheme="http" />
            </Eendpoints>
        </Resources>
    </ServiceManifest>
